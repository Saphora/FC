              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Balaton Sound (between 2007 and 2012 also known as Heineken Balaton Sound, since 2013 as MasterCard Balaton Sound for sponsorship reasons) is one of Europe's largest open air electronic music festivals. Held annually since 2007 on the southern bank of Lake Balaton, Hungary, it features live acts and DJ's from all around the world, from established artists to new names. The event was co-created by the organizers of Sziget Festival. As the festival gets more famous and popular each year, tickets are usually sold out by the end of March at the official ticket vendors; this event sets new attendance records yearly.

The first Balaton Sound festival was held between 12 July and 15 July 2007. The fact that the event was held on the shore of the largest lake in Central Europe in mid-summer, its twenty-hour music schedule, and the line-up gained it significant public interest. The festival is located on the west part of Zamárdi at the crossing of Panoráma and Zöldfa utca (street). Inside the festival area variable stages, lounges, and tents are established for the performances.The sponsors of the festival create luxurious chill-out facilities with hammocks, bean bags, easy chairs. Visitors to Balaton Sound can stay at a special camp site with several pubs, cocktail bars and restaurants equipped with accoutrements absent from Hungary's other summer music festivals. The Main Stage area has a capacity of about 50,000.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Bestival is a four-day music festival held at the Robin Hill country park on the Isle of Wight, England. It has been held annually in late summer since 2004. The event is organized by DJ and record producer Rob da Bank along with his wife Josie and is an off-shoot of his Sunday Best record label and club nights. The initial Bestival attracted 10,000 people, growing to 55,000 in 2010. In 2006 it was voted the Best (Medium-sized) Festival at the 2006 UK Festival Awards, and it was voted the best major UK festival in the UK festival awards 2010 and again in 2012, whilst picking up Fans Favorite Festival in 2011.

The festival has been held annually in late summer since 2004, in a small country park called 'Robin Hill'. The event is organized by BBC Radio 1 left field DJ Rob da Bank and is an off-shoot of his Sunday Best record label and club nights. Creative Director and wife Josie da Bank and co founders / partners John and Ziggy from Get Involved are also involved in organising the event. The Isle of Wight was chosen for many reasons as the site of the Bestival, primarily due to its notable natural beauty. It is also known that the Isle of Wight holds more carnivals per capita than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.

In 2004, the festival was attended by 10,000 people, a figure which has since increased to 43,000 in 2009 and 55,000 in 2010. A family-friendly sister festival "Camp Bestival" launched in 2008. Besides being generally smaller, there are several qualities that make the Bestival different from the Isle of Wight Festival. It is considered more alternative and diverse, offering a large selection of vegetarian foods; a dressing up tent and a 'secret stage'.

Bestival is well known for its fancy dress themed days (usually the Saturday of the festival). In 2005, an attempt was made to set the Guinness World Record for most people in fancy dress at any one event. By 20]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[One of the oldest outdoor festivals in the Netherlands: Dance Valley!

As one of the oldest Outdoor Dance festivals in the Netherlands Dance Valley transforms the Velsen Valley in Spaarnwoude in to a true festival experience with the variety of dance styles. Dance Valley ("The Woodstock of Dance") is an annual dance music festival held in the summer in Spaarnwoude, Netherlands. The first edition was in 1995 when 8,000 people attended (and in 2001 90,000 visitors). Dance Valley grew rapidly, both in duration and number of visitors.

2005 was the first time the event lasted 3 days in the weekend with camping available for the concertgoers at the campsite. It rained. A record-breaking 53,000 people attended that year. There were some big changes to the festival in 2006. Traditionally held on the first weekend of August, due to colliding with another festival UDC (the Dance Valley management company) brought the festival forward two weeks to 14–16 July. While this had little effect in terms of sales it did affect the last two hours of the festival when sunlight was still visible on the horizon. This in turn affected the use of lighting with the lasers not being switched on until later.]]></festivalDescription>

After 3 years, Decibel moved to Lingebos near Gorinchem, but settled permanently at Beekse Bergen close to Tilburg in 2006. The festival grounds are located at a beautiful waterfront with small beaches, wooded areas and cozy little spots to create the ultimate festival feeling. Decibel has grown to include 15 areas showcasing tried and true concepts from the b2s portfolio, such as Pussy lounge, Euphoria, back2school, Hardcore4life and Loudness. 

Since 2011, it's also possible to experience Decibel for a whole weekend.

The bus takes a ‘door-to-door’ route, and you will be dropped off, and picked up next to the festival entrance. You can order your bus tickets in combination with your Defqon.1 entrance tickets, but it’s also possible to purchase a separate bus ticket. Is your boarding location of choice not included in the schedule? 

When you’re traveling to Defqon.1 Weekend Festival with more than 15 people who all want to board at the same place, Event Travel will arrange a pick-up for you!]]></busInfo>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[The FM4 Frequency Festival, also Frequency Festival or just Frequency, formerly Vienna City Festival, is a music festival. Until 2008, it took place near Salzburg Austria, usually every August. In 2009, the Festival moved to St. Pölten. It is promoted by one of Austria's national radio stations, FM4, and is generally associated with the alternative part of mainstream music. 

The lineups accumulate acts of various genres such as rock, electronica and hip hop, usually covering great parts of the German and Austrian alternative, indie and guitar pop scenes, but also featuring well-known international top-acts. The festival was established in 2001. The first year it took place as a rather small event featuring six artists on each of the two days of the festival, which were Friday, the 8th and Saturday, the 9th of June. Musicnet, the company that organizes the Frequency festival, rented the open air stage of the Arena Wien, one of Vienna's leading concert locations. 

The festival, called Vienna City Festival at that time, became an instant success - not only financially, but it was also very much liked by the audience. This quickly lead to the decision of moving it to another location, which would also feature camping facilities.
The Festival has only ever had up to four stages: the Race Stage and the Green Stage as the two big main stages, an Open Stage for which people can apply to show their talent, and an Elektro Tent that opened only in the late hours of the evening and where the party went on until the early hours of the morning.]]></festivalDescription>

              <airplaneInfo><![CDATA[We recommend you to fly into Berlin Tegel or Berlin Schönefeld. From Schönefeld or the Berlin Hauptbahnhof (central station), buses will take you directly to the festival site. Book a seat right here. On top, a regional express train from Schönefeld to Dessau departs every hour. From Berlin Hauptbahnhof, trains can take you to Gräfenhainichen, Lutherstadt Wittenberg or Dessau from where festival shuttle buses will take you to Ferropolis. Depending on where you live, it can make more sense to book a flight to Leipzig airport and take a train or bus from there.]]></airplaneInfo>
              <carInfo><![CDATA[Our Festivaladress is Ferropolisstraße 1, 06773 Gräfenhainichen.

Coming via Highway A9 please use the following exits:
> A9 from Berlin: exit Dessau Ost
> A9 from Munich: Due to construction on the B100, please exit the A9 in Bitterfeld and follow the B100 detour signs to Ferropolis.

Campers and caravans can park their vehicles in the Camping South area. Pitching up tents is strictly prohibited there. Open fires are prohibited as well. Like on our camping site, BBQ grills are allowed. Please follow security orders, otherwise we’ll have to forcably move your vehicle. Also, choose your camping area wisely without hindering the ambulance’s escape route.

If you arrive with a camper or a caravan, we cannot guarantee you a parking space. Therefore we suggest you arrive on Thursday.]]></carInfo>
              <trainInfo><![CDATA[We will charter a train taking you from Amsterdam to Ferropolis – a very unique accommodation for the duration of the festival. Find out more under the following link.

Bus shuttles take festivalgoers, arriving at train stations in Dessau, Gräfenhainichen or Wittenberg to the campsite. We will post our bus schedule shortly before the festival.]]></trainInfo>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Nature One is one of the largest European open air Electronic music festivals, featuring many renowned DJs from Germany and all over the world. In significance it is not as big as Mayday nor as old, having started 3 years later than the Mayday festival. However attendance has surpassed the Mayday, even when one takes into account that the Mayday only lasts one evening, while the Nature One has 2 main evenings with additional smaller events from Thursday till Sunday.

Unlike Love Parade, Nature One costs an admission of approximately 70 Euros (2010). But unlike the love parade, the only real damage to nature occurs by the trampling of the grass on the bunker hills and the fields used for camping (the crops have always been harvested by the time the festival starts). As a special attraction there is a fireworks display on Saturday evening. The festival lasts for one long weekend each year always on the first weekend of August. In 2004 the festival had an attendance of roughly 53,000, with over 40,000 using the nearby fields for camping over the weekend (officially allowed and organized by the Nature One staff).

The camping ground has always been the second festival, with many hobby DJs and some commercially organized trucks, loaded with generators and fuel, the equipment rivaling small clubs in turntables, loudspeakers and sometimes even lighting. Some people who are either unwilling or unable to pay for admission to the festival area use this fact to have a cheaper alternative festival weekend.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Outlook Festival is a musical event hosting all kinds of bass music held just outside of the city of Pula, Croatia. Although held in Croatia, many of the attendees come from Great Britain as do much of the team involved in organizing the festival. Held in Fort Punta Christo and the surrounding beaches the festival is unique in its setting, with sound systems and stages being erected in various tunnels and even the moat of the abandoned ruins.

The festival also plays host to a number of boat parties which feature artists from the festival and sail around the Adriatic coastline playing more a more individual selection of music that other stages around the festival.

The 2011 edition of the festival saw an increase of almost double the capacity and the introduction of a number of new stages. this led to mixed reviews from attendees of the previous festival, some of whom preferred the more intimate setting, however the larger audience allowed festival organisers to book some relatively exclusive artists who perhaps may not have been within the budget otherwise.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Tomorrowland is one of the biggest electronic music festivals held in the world, taking place in Belgium. It used to be organized as a joint venture by the original founders together with ID&T. The festival takes place in the town of Boom, 16 kilometers south of Antwerp, 32 kilometers north of Brussels, and has been organized since 2005. Tomorrowland has since become one of the most notable global music festivals. In March 20, 2013, ID&T Belgium and SFX Entertainment announced that it would begin organizing an American spin-off of Tomorrowland, known as TomorrowWorld. The festival is held at the Bouckaert Farm in Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, located 48 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Atlanta. The site was specifically chosen due to its resemblance to the Boom location in which Tomorrowland is traditionally held.

The inaugural edition of TomorrowWorld, held 27–29 September 2013, reused the "Book of Wisdom" design used for the main stage at Tomorrowland in 2012. The festival played host to over 140,000 attendees over the weekend. TomorrowWorld brought more than music, dancing and stunning visuals to the area last year - it brought an economic boost. Officials reported TomorrowWorld 2013 brought $85.1 million into the Georgia economy, including $70 million directly to Atlanta. That $70 million matches the impact the city got from hosting the NCAA Final Four in 2013. Nearly 140,000 attended the event, and their direct expenditures added $28.7 million into the local economy in areas such as lodging, restaurants and sight-seeing, TomorrowWorld officials said.

The 2014 edition of TomorrowWorld was held on 26-27–28 September 2014. The theme was "The Arising of Life," and used the volcano main stage which debuted at Tomorrowland in 2013. The festival hosted a pre-festival concert called "The Gathering" on Thursday 25 September 2014 for attendees staying in Dreamville, the camp grounds of TomorrowWorld. Over 40,000 people camped at Dreamville, selling out the basic camping option. More than 160,000 people attended TomorrowWorld 2014.]]></festivalDescription>

Ultra Music Festival was founded in 1999 by business partners Russell Faibisch and Alex Omes. The first ever Ultra Music Festival was held as a one-day event at the end of the Winter Music Conference in 1999 with performances by Rabbit in the Moon and DJ Baby Anne. The event was held on South Beach in Miami Beach, Florida, and was a major success. In March 2000, the festival returned to South Beach as a one-day event; the festival was met with even more success and was renewed immediately for a third year.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Bloodstock Open Air is a heavy metal festival held annually at Catton Hall in Walton-upon-Trent, England, since 2005. Previous line-ups have included bands such as Opeth (2008/2010), Children of Bodom (2005/2010), Nightwish (2008), Testament (2007/2012), Arch Enemy (2007/2009), Europe (2009), Twisted Sister (2010), Motörhead (2011), W.A.S.P. (2011) and Alice Cooper (2012). Originally on one stage only, the festival expanded to incorporate a second stage in 2006. Known simply as The Unsigned Stage, it was designed to provide a platform for the next generation of metal talent to reach a wider audience. 

In 2010 it was renamed The New Blood Stage. 2007 saw further expansion with the addition of a third stage, originally called The Lava Stage which in 2009 became the Sophie Lancaster Stage. In 2010 the capacity of this stage was increased and it became the festival's second stage. This second stage is also used by The 4 DJs Of The Apocalypse, who provide DJ sets until the early hours of the morning.

Bloodstock Open Air was conceived as an extension of the original Bloodstock indoor festival which ran from 2001 until 2006 at Derby Assembly Rooms. After an amicable parting in 2006 with his business partner Vince Brotheridge, in 2007 Paul Gregory brought his daughters and son Vicky Hungerford, Rachael Greenfield and Adam Gregory on board as directors. “It was an obvious move for me,” he explained, “as all of them had been working on the festival from its inception. They have brought their talents to the fore as the festival’s continued growth is very much due to their commitment.” 

Bloodstock originally began as an indoor festival held in Derby Assembly Rooms which ran 6 years from 2001-2006. The festival's mascot was based on the local folk tale of The Derby Ram, so chosen to help give the festival roots within Derby where founder Paul Gregory lived, a beast so large that when a butcher finally slaughtered it he drowned in the Ram's blood.]]></festivalDescription>

              <trainInfo><![CDATA[The train will take you to Mol train station for a mere pittance. From there, a shuttle service organised by De Lijn will take you to the festival site. Attention: There are no night trains. If you choose to go home at the end of each festival day, you should keep in mind that the last train out of Mol station is scheduled around half past ten. 

This means you won’t catch the last few bands of the evening as each festival day ends around 1 am (depending on the day). Every festival ticket includes access to our campsite so if you’re planning on leaving the next morning, you can spend the night there.

For just €10, festivalgoers can buy an e-train ticket. This ticket covers the outward and return journey by train in 2nd class between any Belgian departure station (*) and MOL train station. The outward and return journey must be made in the period from Thursday 16th through Monday 20th June 2016.
The Graspop Metal Meeting e-train ticket will be available as of Wednesday 25th May 2016, exclusively online. 

In addition, you also stand a chance of winning one of a host of Graspop Experience packages. They include a signing fast lane ticket that takes you directly to the front of the queue at the signing stand, an exclusive backstage tour and a skydeck pass to watch your favourite band perform from the front of house platform.

When you depart from Brussel-Nationaal-Luchthaven station to Graspop Metal Meeting, the Diabolo fee for the outward and the homeward journey will automatically be added and so make part of the total price of the e-train ticket GMM.

If you’re travelling by Thalys or Eurostar, you should disembark in Antwerp-Central or Brussels South. From there you can take the train to MOL station. The Graspop e-train tickets are not valid on Thalys, Eurostar and other high speed trains.]]></trainInfo>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Hellfest is an annual music festival which takes place in Clisson, France in mid-June. It is held within the Val de Moine sport complex in Clisson, approximately 35 km south-east of the city of Nantes, and approximately 400 km south-west of the nation's capital Paris. Billed as an "extreme music festival", the programme features a variety of heavy metal, hard rock, punk and hardcore acts. Notable artists that have performed at previous editions include Motörhead, Slayer, Angra, Dream Theater, Mötley Crüe, Marilyn Manson, Manowar, Alice Cooper, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, ZZ Top, Lordi, Guns N' Roses and Def Leppard.

The festival was the successor of Fury Fest, which was held in 2002 and 2003 in Clisson and Nantes respectively, and 2004 and 2005 in Le Mans. In June 2009, religious and right-wing groups asked the festival sponsors to disengage from Hellfest. Coca-Cola announced a few days later that they will no longer support the festival. In March 2010, two days before local elections, Prime Minister François Fillon and the leader of the MPF Philippe de Villiers came to support Christophe Béchu, candidate of the UMP for the regional elections of the Pays de la Loire. In front of 1,500 people Mr De Villiers reiterated his support for the candidate and attacked the metal music festival Hellfest: "Our values are not like those of the Regional Council (PS); to be funding a satanic festival!". 

The same month, former minister and leader of the Parti chrétien-démocrate Christine Boutin wrote to Kronenbourg asking them to stop supporting the festival. The 30 March, questioned by deputy Patrick Roy, the minister Frédéric Mitterrand declared to the Assemblée Nationale that the detractors of the festival should calm down. During the 2011 edition an homage was paid to Patrick Roy who died two months before.]]></festivalDescription>

              <busInfo><![CDATA[The festival area of Into The Grave is at a walking distance from the central station. Travelling with public transportation is therefore possible. You can find information about the train schedule here: NS and other means of transportation (bus) here: 9292.nl Please do check your travelling schedule again on the day of the festival!]]></busInfo>
              <carInfo><![CDATA[The best place to park your car is in the garage Oldehoofsterkerkhof, right beneath the festival area. Garages at the Zaailand of the Hoeksterend are also just a few minutes away from the festival. You can find more on this website: parkeergarages Leeuwarden. Unfortunately, this site is only in Dutch. Since Into the Grave takes place on a Saturday, it can be crowded because people are shopping. There are two free P+R (Park and Ride) areas. You park your car a little further from the city centre (but it’s free) and you can take the bus to the center of Leeuwarden. You can find these P+R at the Kalverdijkje, at the eastern ring road of the city. The other one is at the WTC-Expo at the western ring road of the city. You can also park at the P+R in the Wijnhornsterstraat (near the Central Station).]]></carInfo>

The merchandise shopping area was also expanded and is the stage area directly between the inlet control or party tent and the two main stages.

There is a free shuttle bus service to Dinkelsbühl and back is offered, the service runs regularly at ten-minute intervals. In the winter months there is a regularly organized by the Summer Breeze festival organizers called Winter Freeze, which, however, only lasts one day.

              <busInfo><![CDATA[As we have explained multiple times, the current public transport situation via Ansbach is unfortunately not satisfactory. That's why we have been working hard and managed at the last minute to get the transport companies Grimm and Berg involved to avoid a potential bottleneck. The above mentioned companies will offer an additional service between Ansbach Rail Rtation and Dinkelsbühl Schiesswasen from Tuesday until Sunday, using both regular buses and 9-seater minibuses.

There will again be buses for SUMMER BREEZE Open Air from Nuremberg main train station/airport, Stuttgart main train station/ airport and Ulm main train station directly to the main entrance of the festival site in Dinkelsbühl. Please make sure you reserve your seats on these bus transfers before you leave home, ideally online from April 15th, 2015. You will get a confirmation and your travel documents by email immediately after successfully booking your tickets.

The buses have enough loading space to accomodate your tents, beer, etc.]]></busInfo>

              <airplaneInfo><![CDATA[Rental cars can be booked at the airport in Lübeck and at the airport in Hamburg and are the easiest way to travel to Wacken. If you are arriving from Lübeck you would not have detours to Hamburg when renting a car.]]></airplaneInfo>
              <carInfo><![CDATA[Wacken is located approx. 50km northern from Hamburg, and you approach Wacken on the A23. Depending on the traffic situation you will be led by a dynamic traffic control system either over the exit Schenefeld or the exit Hanerau-Hademarschen with the least waiting time to the parking areas. Please follow the traffic control system on the highway and signs along the further arrival route! 

It is in the interest of all festival visitors that you follow the instructions of the stewards and immediately leave the accesses again. Please also use carpools. Plan your Wacken-journey quickly and easily through a clear comparison of different means of transport with the aid of real-time data. We search all the relevant provider for latest offers and save you the time-consuming search on many different websites.

For vehicles over 3,5 tons we provide special areas with a more solid and weight-bearing ground. Please only use these areas with your caravans, caravan combinations and heavy vehicles. Escort vehicles are principally permitted, groups therefore do not have to divide! Watch out for the caravan signs in and around Wacken!

For arrival please use these systems only until reaching our signposted arrival route. Afterwards please only trust our traffic control system. This is even more important for your departure! Because we need to make sure that you do not all take the same motorway. Therefore please follow the signs for departure, also if it seems to be a detour at first. Only start using the navigation systems after you reached the motorway. This will at least help in Northern Germany to avoid theSunday traffic jams. ATTENTION: We will use the A 23 and the A 7 as routes to the South!!!]]></carInfo>
              <trainInfo><![CDATA[The legendary Metal Train is a great alternative to the regular trains. The train carries Metalheads to Wacken since more than 10 years. We created a special express train from Itzehoe to Elmshorn and Hamburg. The train starts in the night from Saturday to Sunday. The nearest train station is located at Itzehoe, which is connected to the festival by our official shuttle buses and cabs.]]></trainInfo>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Appelpop is a two-day pop festival in the Dutch town of Tiel that always takes place in the second weekend of September, in the same weekend as the Fruitcorso takes place. The festival was first held in 1991 in the town centre with a few hundred visitors, but it soon became bigger and moved to a parking place adjacent to the river Waal. 

With 180.000 visitors in 2008, it is the biggest free festival in the Netherlands that lasts for more than one day. During the years, many bands (mostly Dutch bands) have played on this festival. Anouk, Bløf, Krezip and Within Temptation have all played more than once on Appelpop.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[The Festival Internacional de Benicàssim commonly abbreviated to simply FIB, is an annual music festival which takes place in the town of Benicàssim, Spain. It focuses mainly on pop, rock and electronica artists, as well as having other elements including short films, fashion shows and art. Benicassim has a reputation as being among the best on the international festival circuit.

FIB is notable for being located in close proximity to several beaches, having bands play later in the day (5pm - 8am) and attracting a young, party-oriented crowd. The festival begins on the second Monday of July when the camping grounds open, although music only officially commences during Thursday afternoon. In 2009, the festival capacity exceeded 50,000[5] people for the first time and continues to grow, being popular among many Britons due to the good weather. Past performers include Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, Oasis and Bob Dylan]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Glastonbury Festival is a five-day festival of contemporary performing arts that takes place near Pilton, Somerset. In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. 

Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people, requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water, and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.

Inspired by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements, the festival retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers.

Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. Glastonbury Festival was held intermittently from 1970 until 1981; since then, it has been held every year, except for "fallow years" taken every five years, intended to give the land, local population, and organisers a break.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise, mostly just known as Lowlands, is an annual three day music and performing arts festival, held in the Netherlands in August since 1993. Although the main focus is on music - rock, pop, dance, hip hop and alternative - Lowlands also offers indoor and outdoor cinema, (street) theatre, cabaret and stand-up, ballet, literature and comic strips. Lowlands is attended by around 55,000 visitors, spread over 200 acts and more than ten stages every year which are named according to the NATO phonetic alphabet apart from the Grolsch stage (named after the beer brewer Grolsch who has been the main sponsor of the festival for the last few years). 

The majority of stages are inside huge tents - insurance against the Netherlands climate - with the main stage's tent, Alpha, being approximately the size of a regulation football pitch. The festival is held 68 kilometres (42 mi) east of Amsterdam in Biddinghuizen, Flevoland province; at Spijk en Bremerberg, which is adjacent to the Walibi Holland amusement park.]]></festivalDescription>

Bus route: Gdynia Main Railway Station - Janka Wiśniewskiego - Estakada Kwiatkowskiego - Unruga - Bosmańska - Zielona - Open'er Festival. Buses don't stop and take no passengers on the way to the festival.
 
On the return journey to Gdynia Main Railway Station, all stops for other lines (save the first two stops on Zielona St.) are in use as request stops, for passengers getting off the bus only.

Buses arriving at Zielona St (Wąwóz Ostrowicki stop) from Gdynia Main Railway Station ONLY take passengers towards Babie Doły if the promoter services decide it to be safe. The bus frequency depends on the number of passengers and traffic in the opposite direction.

The wristbands enable you to travel by the SKM city rail on all routes limited by Tczew – Wejherowo and  Gdańsk Wrzeszcz - Gdańsk Port Lotniczy (Airport) – Gdańsk Osowa – Gdynia Główna stations]]></busInfo>

              <isTopFestival><![CDATA[No]]></isTopFestival>
              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Pinkpop Festival or Pinkpop is a large, annual music festival held at Landgraaf, Netherlands. It is usually held on the Pentecost weekend (Pinksteren in Dutch, hence the name). Starting in 1970, at Burgemeester Damen Sportpark in the town of Geleen, PinkPop is the oldest and longest running annual dedicated pop and rock music festival in the world. Nowadays, Pinkpop is a three day festival, from Saturday through Monday, with a 60,000 people per day capacity, and with performances on 3 separate stages. During 44 editions, more than 2 million people have attended Pinkpop. Some 700 music acts have played at the festival. From 2006 through 2011, Pinkpop sold out six years in a row.

In 1994 (the 25th edition), it was decided to sell only 60,000 tickets, to prevent overcrowding due to the popularity of the festival. In 1995, it was made into a 2-day festival. Two years later, in 1997, this was further expanded to three days.
2007 saw a spin-off, later in the year, on 11 August, called Pinkpop Classic, for an older rock audience, with bands that previously performed there in past decades. This spin-off was held again in following years, with exception of 2011, in which the organisation was not able to sign enough interesting older bands.

In 2008, Pinkpop was for the first time in its history not held on Pentecost weekend, which fell too early that year for the convenience of fans and performers alike. This was decided following the 2005 edition, in which the Pentecost weekend also fell early and therefore Pinkpop could not convince many great performers to come play at the festival. Sales were disappointing in 2005, so by shifting the 2008 festival, the organisation hoped to solve these problems. Pinkpop 2008 turned out to have had the largest concert attendance to date. The dates for the 2010, 2013 and 2015 edition have been shifted as well, for similar reasons]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Primavera Sound is a music festival that takes place between the end of May and beginning of June in Barcelona, Catalonia. The first edition took place in 2001 in Poble Espanyol and in 2005 it moved to the Parc del Fòrum, a much larger site on the seafront. The nature of the festival (urban and an integrated part of the city) and the wide range of bands represented have made Primavera Sound a meeting point for artists and spectators from all generations. 

The festival has always succeeded in bringing together in its line up both the latest independent music tendencies and artists with a consolidated career, while presenting all styles and genres and being fully committed to quality pop, rock and the most underground tendencies of electronic and dance music.]]></festivalDescription>

Moreover, since 2009, some concert footage on WDR will broadcast television.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[The Southside Festival (or, simply, Southside) is an annual music festival that takes place near Tuttlingen, southern Germany, usually every June. The festival as well as its, artists and audiences are generally associated within the alternative part of popular music.The Hurricane Festival, often referred to as the "sister" of Southside, takes place on the same three days in the very north of Germany (contrary to Southside, which is in the very south). 

Together they form a twin festival, since they usually feature the same line-up of artists with only minor exceptions. Following the great success of the Hurricane Festival, organizers FKP Scorpio decided to launch a similar event in the south of Germany. In 1999, a former military airbase (Neubiberg bei München) in Neubiberg, near Munich, was selected as the venue. In 2000, the festival was moved to another former military airbase, this time in Neuhausen ob Eck, which is close to Freiburg and Stuttgart.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Le Guess Who? is a Dutch music festival featuring independent music in styles such as noise rock, indie rock, and IDM, held in Utrecht since 2007. The festival takes place on various locations in the city of Utrecht.

During most editions the line-up consists of more than sixty acts that rarely perform in the Netherlands or acts that have their first show there. The first edition in 2007 only featured Canadian acts but nowadays the festival has many international acts that make an appearance. The festival takes place in the last week of November. 

Due to the touring schedule of many of the bands, the line-up has a big overlap with other European festivals that take place in the same period.]]></festivalDescription>

The events take place simultaneously on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend, sharing the same bill. The Reading Festival is held at Little John's Farm on Richfield Avenue in central Reading, near the Caversham Bridge. The Leeds event is held in Bramham Park, near Wetherby, the grounds of an historic house. Campsites are available at both sites and weekend tickets include camping. Day tickets are also sold.

The Reading Festival, the original and senior leg of the two, is the world's oldest popular music festival still in existence. It has had various musical phases over the years, as detailed below. In the twin-site era, rock, alternative, indie, punk and metal have tended to dominate. The festivals are run by Festival Republic, which was divested from Mean Fiddler Music Group. For promotional purposes during 1998-2007 they were known as the Carling Weekend: Reading and the Carling Weekend: Leeds. Unsurprisingly, these titles were seldom used when not required, although NME did so as part of its involvement. 

In November 2007, the organisers welcomed "Reading Festival reclaiming its prestigious name" when the sponsored title was abolished after 9 years. In 2011, the capacity of the Reading site was 87,000 and the Leeds site was 75,000. This was an increase of several thousand on previous years]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Lollapalooza is an annual music festival featuring popular alternative rock, heavy metal, punk rock, hip hop, and EDM bands and artists, dance and comedy performances and craft booths. It has also provided a platform for non-profit and political groups and various visual artists. Conceived and created in 1991 by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell as a farewell tour for his band, Lollapalooza ran annually until 1997, and was revived in 2003. From its inception through 1997 and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the festival organizers decided to expand the dates to two days per city, but poor ticket sales forced the 2004 tour to be canceled. In 2005, Farrell and the William Morris Agency partnered with Austin, Texas–based company Capital Sports Entertainment (now C3 Presents) and retooled it into its current format as a weekend destination festival in Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois.

In 2010 it was announced that Lollapalooza would debut outside of the United States, with a branch of the festival staged in Chile's capital Santiago on April 2–3, 2011 where they partnered up with Santiago-based company Lotus. In 2011, the company Geo Events confirmed the Brazilian version of the event, which was held at the Jockey Club in São Paulo on 7 and 8 April 2012. In September 2013, Buenos Aires was selected as the third Lollapalooza in South America, starting on April 2014, and in November 2014, the first European Lollapalooza was announced, which will be held at the former Tempelhof Airport in Berlin]]></festivalDescription>

In November 2007, the organisers welcomed "Reading Festival reclaiming its prestigious name" when the sponsored title was abolished after 9 years. In 2011, the capacity of the Reading site was 87,000 and the Leeds site was 75,000. This was an increase of several thousand on previous years.

The Reading Festival originates from the National Jazz Festival, which was conceived by Harold Pendleton (founder of the Marquee Club in London) and was first held at Richmond Athletic Ground in 1961. This festival, in turn, took inspiration from events held in America. Throughout its first decade the festival changed names and moved around sites several times, being held at Windsor Racecourse, Kempton Park and Plumpton, before reaching its permanent home at Reading in 1971.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Rock am Ring is an annual music festival at the Nürburgring in the Eifel near Adenau (Germany). It was first held in 1985. The intention was to organize a one-off event, but by the large attendance (75,000 spectators), they decided a recurring festival of it. The only exception is 1989/1990: After the low attendance in 1988 was two years break inserted.

Since 1991 it is the largest rock festival in Germany. Since 1997, while the Rock im Park festival held in Nuremberg. Most of the artists that are contracted for Rock am Ring also act on Rock im Park. The festival lasts for three days and the festival grounds around are several campsites.

The Rock am Ring (German: Rock at the Ring) and Rock im Park (German: Rock in the Park) festivals are two simultaneous rock music festivals held annually. While Rock am Ring takes place at the Nürburgring racetrack in Nürburg, in the west; Rock im Park takes place at the Zeppelinfeld in Nuremberg, in the south.

Both festivals are usually regarded as one event with a mostly identical lineup for both festivals. All artists perform one day at Nürburgring and another day in Nuremberg during the three-day event. There have been minor exceptions in the past years where an artist would be announced for one of the festivals only. Together Rock im Park and Rock am Ring are the largest music festivals and one of the largest in the world with a combined attendance of just over 150,000 people in 2007, selling out both events in advance for the first time.

Rock am Ring was originally planned as a one-time festival celebrating the inauguration of a newer, shorter version of the track in 1985, but due to its commercial success (with 75,000 audience members), it was decided to make the concert an annual event. However, after a dip in attendance for the 1988 event, the festival was put on hiatus for two years.]]></festivalDescription>

It is advisable to take the same route home. Special road signage will be set up to help you join the motorway.

Parking
In the vicinity of the festival ground there are about fifteen car parks, all within walking distance of the festival site and campsites and run by local organisations. For safety reasons cars, folding trailers and other vehicles are not allowed on the campsites. It is also forbidden to camp in the car parks.

Car parks are divided into 3 zones (zones A, B and C). Each of the visitor routes leads to one of these zones. It is advisable not to change zones because this is likely to create traffic queues.

Parking your car costs 20 euros if you arrive on Wednesday 24 June or 15 euros if you arrive on Thursday 25 June or later. Please note: the parking sticker must be displayed in the car as proof of payment. Each car park has a different sticker. You only need to pay for parking once. If spaces are still available in the car park for which your sticker applies, simply go and park your car again. However, if you leave the car park and it is full on your return you will have to buy a new sticker for another car park.

Parking for motorbikes, scooters: there is a manned park for motorbikes. A parking ticket costs 10 euros. Please note: you will be given a parking ticket as a proof of payment. Do not lose this parking ticket, because it allows you to park again free of charge if you leave the park.

Parking for buses: you'll find free parking on Tremelobaan (Ecowerf parking site) in Werchter, or on Wijgmaalsesteenweg in Haacht.]]></carInfo>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[The Roskilde Festival is an annual music festival held south of Roskilde in Denmark. It is one of the largest music festivals in Europe and the largest in Northern Europe. It was created in 1971 by two high school students, Mogens Sandfær and Jesper Switzer Møller, and promoter Carl Fischer. In 1972, the festival was taken over by the Roskilde Foundation, which has since run the festival as a non-profit organization for development and support of music, culture and humanism. In 2014, the Roskilde Foundation provided festival participants with the opportunity to nominate and vote upon which organizations should receive funds raised by the festival.

The Roskilde Festival is Denmark's first music-oriented festival created for hippies, and today covers more of the mainstream youth from Scandinavia and the rest of Europe. The Roskilde Festival 2013 had more than 180 performing bands and was attended by some 130,000 festivalgoers, along with more than 21,000 volunteers, 5,000 media people and 3,000 artists – totaling almost 160,000 people who participated in the festival. Until the mid-1990s, the festival attracted mostly Scandinavians, but in recent years it has become more and more international (with an especially large influx of Germans, Australians and British)]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Super Bock Super Rock is a rock festival in Portugal, created in 1994. It has become one of the biggest festivals in the country, luring many rock and metal fans. Since its foundation, many famous artists have played at the festival. The festival has also changed location many times. However, from 2010 to 2020, it is expected to be held at Meco, in the municipality of Sesimbra. It is named after its principal sponsor, Super Bock beer. The festival takes place by some of the most beautiful beaches in Portugal, just a mere 20 minutes train ride from Lisbon city centre. Super Bock Super Rock is one of the longest running festivals in Europe. Previous editions of the festival have included music giants The Strokes, Arcade Fire, Muse, New Order, Pixies and Metallica to name just few.

An amazing line-up, affordable ticket prices, good weather, beach setting, easy access and the opportunity to make a beach holiday or city break out of the festival experience, make Super Bock Super Rock one of the strongest contenders of the European festival circuit. The 14th edition of Super Bock Super Rock was held in July 2008, with a similar format as in 1999 and 2003, i.e. in different cities. It was held in Lisbon and in Porto. In Porto, the festival was on 4 and 5 July, while in Lisbon it was on 9 and 10 July. The 16th edition of Super Bock Super Rock was held in Meco, Sesimbra on 16, 17 and 18 July. There were 3 stages at the event: Palco Super Bock, Palco EDP and @Meco. There are 3 positions in the festival for winners of the "Super Bock Super Rock Preload Competition". These bands win by gaining more votes from the public.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[The festival for new music! Since being founded in 2006, The Great Escape has been firmly established internationally as the leading event for showcasing new music. Taking place in Brighton over 3 days in May, The Great Escape kicks starts the festival season, introducing 15,000 music lovers to the key artists and sounds of the year. With over 350 bands playing in 30 venues over 3 days, The Great Escape is the key date in the music calendar. In addition to pre-publicised performances, impromptu street gigs spring up all over town. The Alternative Escape, numerous club nights, label parties, industry showcases, unique collaborations and outdoor gigs all add to the festivities.

“If anyone had any doubts that The Great Escape is the most important UK music festival for new bands, new trends and making new friends then they most certainly got knocked out of the water this year. 10 years in, and TGE went harder than ever before.” “Although similar to the new-music mecca SXSW in Texas, in many ways Britain’s equivalent event is better: more manageable, less brand-led and with just as many emerging talents, who play in tiny venues across Brighton.”
The Times

‘The festival sits in a space all of its own. Billing a very international line-up in a very British city, it can rival any of the international competitors and tops the pile in the UK for value and variety alone.’]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[The Zwarte Cross Festival is the biggest paid festival in the Netherlands, and the biggest motor event in the world. The 18th edition in 2014 had 185.276 visitors. and the 19th edition in 2015 counted in at 197.450 visitors. The festival is a combination of motorcross, music, theatre and stunts. 'Zwarte Cross' literally means 'black cross'; it is a reference to the illegal motor races in the 1960s. The first edition of the Zwarte Cross took place in 1997. 

It was a motorcross in which anyone could compete on a motorcycle, moped or scooter. About 150 people competed, and there were 1000 visitors. The day was concluded with a concert of the organizing rock band, Jovink en de Voederbietels. Although the name suggested the race was illegal, the organisation had all the needed permits.

The festival proved to be successful, and the second edition had 350 competitors, and 4000 visitors, but a lot of people got injured. Therefore, the organisation decided to cooperate with a professional motorcross-club, HALMAC in Halle. The third edition was held on their official Grand Prix circuit. In 2007, the festival moved to Lichtenvoorde.

The mascot and logo of the Zwarte Cross is 'Tante Rikie', Rikie Nijman, the mother of Jovink's manager, André Nijman. She is the unofficial festival CEO and is well-known by the visitors. During the festival, she is carried around in a sedan chair, and visitors kneel for her.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[The one race ... human! African-Caribbean Festival (named among the visitors also "ACF") will be held at the fairground in Aschaffenburg since 1998. With approximately 50,000-60,000 visitors, it is one of the largest festivals of its kind in Europe. Since 1998 the "Africa-Caribbean Festival" takes place (1998-2000 Africa Cultural Festival) in the Aschaffenburg district. On the left side of  the former main parade ground. The festival is called by visitors and fans mostly as "AKF". With one exception, in 2002, the date of the event always moves to the second weekend in August. Untill 2004 the ACF lasted for three days, since the 2005 edition there are four full days of festival fun!

In addition to a framework and culture program with World Bazaar, Beach and Kids Area, Culture Stage and food vendors from around the world carrying the line-up, consisting of world-and German superstars, scene sizes, world music and newcomers to the success of the festival.  Thus were already at the African Caribbean Festival artists such as Xavier Naidoo, Shaggy, Jan Delay & Disko No.. 1, Fettes Brot, Culcha Candela, Friends, The Wailers and Thomas D. on stage.

The basic idea of the African-Caribbean Festival was to initiate a family-friendly multi-day festival, which transports the music and culture of the African continent and the Caribbean, bringing it to the domestic audience. Over the years the festival has evolved from this thought  to one of the largest festivals of its kind in Europe! Nowhere in the Rhine-Main region is so important for international understanding, joy of life, high-profile artists and a huge cultural offer. Each year, a portion of the net proceeds to the association One Race Human eV, which sends it funds one to one to social projects. The association has made it his mission to spread the message that there is only one race, not white, black, yellow or red, but man.]]></festivalDescription>

              <festivalDescription><![CDATA[Couleur Café is a festival that proposes a full array of music styles coming from all over the world. With more then 40 concerts over three days, Couleur Café offers the best of R&B, hip hop, world, afro, reggae, ragga, dub, dancehall, Latin, salsa, electro and rock.

Some extra juicy ingredients are added such as the bright souks and decorations, world food stalls, craftsmen and blazing brass bands. Couleur Café is an apt reflection of the city it calls home, Brussels, with its cultural mix that makes travelling the world as easy as looking out your front window.

Couleur Café is more than a globe-trotting urban festival. The Cool Art Café exposition features work by contemporary artists from the ‘North’ and ‘South’ with a typical Couleur Café-touch. The Solidarity Village wants to sensitize the audience about international social problems.

10 NGOs and associations provide information about awareness-raising campaigns and concrete solutions for worldwide social problems.]]></festivalDescription>

The bigger, faster, stronger trend Festival Mundial is in recent years, will put a stop to the railway zone with the move. Mundial returns to an intimate and accessible edition full of promising talent from all over the world. After a quarter of a century of Festival Mundials in beautiful Leijpark it is time for renewal. The disappearance of various funders and sponsors, and by increasing production and programming costs, the pressure is high. They want to maintain the approachable and open character of Festival Mundial and due to the high costs its threatened to be lost. Also programming international big names like Moby, NERD Pitbull and many others could not provide the desired effect. Festival Mundial is threatened to hit its visitors and its own artistic and idealistic vision. 

Festival Mundial recreated the intimacy by reducing the number of visitors and creating several area's, each with a unique and intimate atmosphere. Ranging from large to small and from indoor to outdoor the Festival Mundial offers you many different stages. Located in the picnic area and sip a drink. Enjoy music from global talent. Strolling around the bazaar and night market. Be surprised by street theater and dance merge into beautiful and exciting circus acts. That's all at Festival Mundial in Spoorzone.]]></festivalDescription>

The festival spans five days (Wednesday - Sunday) and its main focus is showcasing new music, both Icelandic and international. The festival's main sponsors are Icelandair and the City of Reykjavík.

The first show was held in 1999 as a one-off event in an airplane hangar at Reykjavík Airport. Subsequently, it has become one of the premier showcases for new music in the world, with hundreds of journalists and industry people in attendance. Airwaves has become known for its intimacy and party spirit. The festival has been called "the hippest long weekend on the annual music-festival calendar" (David Fricke, Rolling Stone) and an "unbelievable zest for music and celebration" (Jonah Flicker, Pitchforkmedia).]]></festivalDescription>

              <busInfo><![CDATA[In case you are staying somewhere in the city and plan to get to Sziget by public transportation, plan your exact route with the help of the route planner of the Budapest transportation network. With your Sziget-Budapest Citypass you can travel more easily! More info on the Citypass 2016 edition is coming soon! Until then.

The nearest public transportation station to Sziget is by the HÉV line (suburban railway - H5), called Filatorigát. The train runs every 10 minutes during the day to Sziget and also during the night in every 15-20 minutes.]]></busInfo>

              <carInfo><![CDATA[If you are coming to Sziget by car, you will probably want to know more about parking! Check out the official Sziget website for more information about parking!]]></carInfo>
              <trainInfo><![CDATA[Budapest has three major train stations: Nyugati Pályaudvar, Keleti Pályaudvar, Déli Pályaudvar. From any of these train stations you can get to Sziget very easily by public transportation. Plan the best route to the festival via the BKK (Centre for Budapest Transport) 

The Sziget-Budapest Citypass is also your friend when it comes to public transportation! More info on it is coming soon!

But we also have some tips:
From Nyugati Pályaudvar (20-25 minutes)
Take Tram 4-6 (right in front of the station) towards Széll Kálmán Tér. Get off the tram at the third stop called Margit Híd-Budai Hídfő. You will cross the Danube on the beautiful Margharet Bridge. On one side you can see the Margharet Island and on the other side you can see the Parliament and also the Castle!

At Margit Híd-Budai Hídfő take the stairs and get on the HÉV towards Szentende / Békásmegyer. The Sziget stop is called Filatorigát (4th stop). Get off here and follow the crowd until the entrance!

From Keleti Pályaudvar (40-45 minutes):
Look for the metro sign at the station! You should get on Metro 2 - Red Line towards Déli Pályaudvar. Travel on this air-conditioned, comfy vehicle until Batthyányi Tér (5th stop).

At the Batthyányi Tér station look for the HÉV lines and get on this train-like wagon chain and ride until Filatorigát (5th stop). Get off here and follow the crowd until the entrance!

From Déli Pályaudvar (25-30 minutes)
Look for the metro sign at the station! You should get on Metro 2 - Red Line towards Örs Vezér Tér. Travel on this air-conditioned, comfy vehicle until Batthyányi Tér (2nd stop).

At the Batthyányi Tér station look for the HÉV lines and get on this train-like wagon chain and ride until Filatorigát (5th stop). Get off here and follow the crowd until the entrance!]]></trainInfo>

            <description><![CDATA[You never know who you're going to meet on the first day of school. Sometimes, you can end up being introduced to one of the best friends you'll ever know. That was the case for Clemens and Philipp—otherwise known as Milky Chance. The Kassel, Germany duo met in an "Advanced Music Course" at the start of eleventh grade, and they creatively gelled right off the bat. "On that first day, you're looking around the classroom trying to see who's cool and who's not," laughs Clemens. "We clicked though. It didn't take long at all for us to notice that we got along great."

They got along so great that they played in a local band until graduation. Even though the group disbanded when their drummer left Kassel, Clemens and Philipp kept on making music. Weaving together elegant electronic production with acoustic guitars and lilting, lush vocals, they harnessed a style unequivocally their own. Clemens put it best, "Think of it as the singer-songwriter spirit mixed with electronic beats. Somehow, it's always a little bit melancholy, but there's a positive spin. You can dance to most of it too! Melancholy is something that I carry within me. I write the best songs when this mood catches me.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Connection. If one word sums up the phenomenon of Above & Beyond then that is surely it. Whether it’s the thousands of A&B fans singing their lyrics back at them at gigs from Beirut to Brixton, or the millions that tune in for their weekly Group Therapy radio show, connection – real human connection - is at the heart of all things that define Above & Beyond.

Much like acts like The Smiths or Joy Division before them, Above & Beyond find themselves embedded at the heart of their fans' lives. Some walk down the wedding aisle to their songs, others ink their bodies with their lyrics, often a proud couple will choose to get engaged at one of their gigs. All that pledge their loyalty to them are moved in a way that goes beyond most electronic music out there.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[AC Slater has begun a lengthy career for himself with his "Night Bass" sound by fusing elements of house music with the dirty basslines of UK garage and sprinkles of old-school rave synths and breaks. AC Slater's career kicked off with a bang in 2008, with his seminal remix of "Turn the Music Up" on Trouble & Bass becoming an instant anthem. Moby listed it as one of the best 10 tracks of the decade, declaring it a "perfect song." AC has collaborated with influential underground artists such as Nina Sky all the way to chart toppers like Far East Movement, and has done official remixes for the likes of Big Sean, Moby, Robin S. and many more. 

A quick look at Slater's Beatport page reveals well over 100 tracks and remixes over the last five years, including his best-selling Jack Got Jacked EP, a blatant declaration of the invasion of house music by all things bass (and the start of a lengthy friendship with Jack Beats). Fast forward to the present, AC has toured the globe several times and his tunes have been played at every major festival and club in the world by DJs including Skrillex, Diplo and so many more. Slater's tunes and guest mixes can regularly be heard on major radio stations across the world, including the UK's BBC Radio 1 and Rinse FM and Australia's Triple J. His crew Trouble & Bass and his own record label Party Like Us continue to release some of the most groundbreaking and forward-thinking bass-heavy dance music in the underground]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[With 40+ awards to date, DJ sets that see him play mainstages from EDC to Global Gathering, and a reputation as the go-to remixer for the likes of Major Lazer, Rudimental, London Grammar and beyond, Andy C’s list of achievements grows by the week.

A reputation as one of the most significant British artists in global dance music has been hard earned, but it’s hard to place the tipping points. Was it his performance at Radio 1’s Hackney weekend, where his set was watched online by more people than either Jay Z or Rihanna? When he performed to 85,000 people at Glastonbury in 2013? Or when his remix of Major Lazer charted on iTunes after being added to the Radio 1 Playlist?

Andy’s success and status as a festival main stage headliner and DJ who guarantees sell-out roadblocks are driven by a phenomenal work ethic and the kind of tour schedule that makes rock bands look like part-timers.

Recognised as a cover star by both Mixmag and DJ Mag (he also won the latter’s Best British DJ Award 2013), he recently sold out London’s Electric Brixton in a matter of days. His eagerly awaited Nightlife 6 compilation ran riot across iTunes dance compilation chart and hit No.1 on Beatport. Zane Lowe and Annie Mac gave his equally anticipated new original productions, ‘Haunting’ and ‘Workout’, pride of place on their Radio 1 shows, which in turn followed a special programme on Radio 1 dedicated to Ram Records itself.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Armed with an unmatched ear for kicks and a passion for hardstyle that began during his early childhood, B-Front has continuously challenged hardstyle music norms throughout the years. For the Dutch producer, what started out as a basement hobby quickly became a full-fledged career in one of the most competitive sectors of the music industry. It hasn’t come easily, but then again, success on the scale that B-Front has managed to achieve usually takes years of hard work and perseverance.

The results, however, have been astronomical. Now considered a major pioneer within the hardstyle community, B-Front has come a long way since his days curating house parties and local raves. His forward-thinking production style and knack for creating dark, sonorous soundscapes has won the support of artists such as Digital Punk, Ran-D, Titan, Alpha2, Frontliner and Adaro (to name a few). In 2006, his chart-topping hit “Lunatick” put him on the radar of many industry heavyweights and helped launch what would prove to be a straight run of successful releases.

As a DJ, it was getting to headline festivals such as Defqon.1 Festival, Loudness, Mysteryland, Hard Bass and Thrillogy that turned B-Front into a household name within the global hardstyle scene. His work as part of the Fusion Records family is unprecedented within his musical niche, and he credits the label for having helped him develop his art and his musical trademark. He currently enjoys a residency at the legendary Dutch event ‘Loudness’ and is frequently involved with a variety of emerging independent labels. His primary motivator as an artist remains the same as when he first discovered his love for beats.

“I followed my heart...I used to sit in my bedroom imagining what it would be like to DJ big events. It’s a cool thing to watch a dream like that become a reality.” 
-B-Front]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Bass Modulators is a collaboration between the Dutch Roland Evers and Rick Buijtenhek that started back in 2007. Two friends since high school, both with a great passion for music who found their true believe in Hardstyle at the age of 17. The adventure started from the moment that they put a demo online of one of their first tracks and got an offer from DJ’s United records to release it. When Tatanka saw their talent as the top man of DJU, he offered them the possibility to have their own label. 

This resulted in the successful (sub)Label ‘Orange Records’ where they were able to express their creativity. This was also the place where they released their immense hits like ‘Quarantine’, ‘NRGizer’ and ‘Take it Back’. The year that followed was one great adventure. The successes resulted in a lot of amazing gigs with major support from fans as well as organizations and other DJ’s. The gigs kept coming and they flew all around the world to spread their sound. 

They played at some of the biggest stages and festivals in Europe like Q-Base, Emporium and the Qontinent, and now they’re even heading up for some bigger stuff.. One year and lots of releases later, they got the offer to join the world leading Scantraxx label. This was an offer they couldn’t refuse and so they took this big step to share their unique and improved sound with the world under the famous Scantraxx imprint.

Working in the studio 24/7 and aiming for the highest regions they show they're up for the job. There won’t be any damage control!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Berlin born DJ, producer and label owner Ben Klock is without a doubt one of the most significant characters in techno’s recent history. A resident at Berghain since its opening in 2004, he has been able to leave his mark on the club’s unique sound, in turn the special space influenced Klock’s approach as a DJ and producer as well.

Playing techno sets full of hypnotic, deep and heavy grooves, releasing records on Ostgut Ton and last but not least the aesthetics of his own label Klockworks (founded in 2006), have earned him an excellent international reputation over the last few years. Supported by stringent and enthralling tracks, remixes for such diverse artists as Kerri Chandler, Martyn or Depeche Mode, the revered debut album “One” on Ostgut Ton and his Berghain mix, Ben Klock’s name is synonymous with the vitalization of an essential definition of techno.

His music is free of crippling nostalgia and rather wins you over with consistency, tension, and dynamics and time and time again with a sensibility, one would usually expect from house music. In this vein, Klock pursues an unexacting fusion of quantum jumps and tradition – including effortless melodies or hook lines. Being able to harmonize this method of industrial austerity, natural musicality and an impressive physicality is Ben Klock’s great art and skill.

And of course his monthly marathon sets at Berghain that escort all what’s being said with pure sound and consistently motivate Ben Klock to skip the trapdoor called routine.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Adegbenga Adejumo (born 28 November 1986), known as Benga, is a British musician from Croydon, known for being the pioneer of dubstep record production. As a teenager he used to hang out at the Big Apple record shop in Croydon and make his own tunes at home on a PlayStation. 

The tunes caught the attention of dubstep producer Hatcha, who worked at the shop, and, by the age of 15, Benga had made his first record, "Skank", released on Big Apple's own record label. He was also one of the first dubstep producers when the style was emerging in the early 2000s. He has been featured on a variety of compilations including Mary Anne Hobbs's Warrior Dubz, Tempa's The Roots of Dubstep and the BBC Radio 1Xtra anniversary mix.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[DJ BL3ND’s road to success was not easy. With the steady creation of crazy videos and high energy mixes, he built a career out of nothing into an internationally acclaimed DJ act by gathering a global fanbase of BL3NDERS. In 2009, he was catapulted into the public eye with his Club Mix YouTube video where he donned his signature mask. The video racked up over 80 million hits and DJ BL3ND was born. Within 3 years, he was playing clubs and festivals around the US (including Electric Zoo, Spring Awakening and Electric Adventure) and in the process, creating one of the most engaging live shows of any touring artist. 

There’s a certain energy to his performances that you don’t get with a normal DJ. Whether it’s for a club of 300 people or a festival of 20,000, DJ BL3ND never fails to electrify audiences with his high-octane mixing and passionate crowd interaction. Over the years, his success has been documented by everyone from Billboard, to SoundCloud, to DJ Mag. He’s the record-holder on Billboard’s Uncharted Chart, holding the top spot for 62 weeks and remaining in the charts for a total of 103 weeks; and he was named SoundCloud ‘Artist of the Year.’ He won his hard-earned place in the prestigious DJ Mag Top 100 in 2013, coming in at #91, and in 2014, jumped to #78 on the chart, solidifying his position as one of the world’s top performers.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Seemingly rising from nowhere, South Yorkshire-born producer and DJ Jamie Roberts aka, Blawan, first came to prominence with his debut release Fram on the forward-thinking dubstep label Hessle Audio. Standing apart from the crowd with his clanking, stepping percussive beats, Blawan inked a deal with legendary techno label R&S Records, and released his first EP for the label in 2011. Bohla's mix of post-dubstep sounds and raw, techno-influenced beats saw the EP championed by DJs such as Surgeon and the Black Dog. What You Do with What You Have followed a few months later on R&S, and a remix of the Radiohead track "Bloom" -- for their TKOL RMX 1234567 album -- helped Blawan's popularity grow throughout 2011.

Sought after for his remix work and joining forces with fellow R&S producer Pariah -- for their hardware-only project Karenn -- 2012 saw Blawan's own output slow. A performance on the internet streaming, club-based show Boiler Room brought fresh acclaim, with one track in particular -- "Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage" from 2012's His He She & She EP -- gaining huge popularity. In 2013, Blawan joined forces with early supporter Surgeon for a release on Blawan's own vinyl-only label Works the Long Nights under the guise Trade.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Cassy is a strong, independent and unique individual whose feminine power and sensitive musical flow delivers diverse techno with soul, warmth, elegance and a touch of mystery. “Always since I can remember, especially in the Austrian village I grew up in, I was surrounded by music. One of my first and strongest musical memories is of having a ladybird turntable, I played it so much it was demolished in the end.” Born in England and raised in Austria, with her mother from Austria and father from Barbados, Cassy was exposed to many cultures growing up. She went to music school at the age of five before joining a local children’s choir, where she would wear traditional Austrian dress and sing in monasteries. 

As a young girl, Cassy met jazz musicians including Sun Ra, Archie Shepp and Lester Bowie, when they stayed at her parent’s countryside inn on their way to play an Austrian jazz festival, organized by her parents’ friends. “Sun Ra was this super mega cosmic guy, an out there character. These people must have been a big influence on me. They left a trace behind of somewhere I knew I belonged, without knowing how to get there.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[From a young age, Coone has been mesmerized by music in all its different shapes and forms. The creation of his successful label Dirty Workz was a huge step in this young man's carreer, allowing him to take his music beyond even his own expectations and also giving new talents within the Hard Dance scene a respectable platform to launch new and exciting sounds into the scene.

By the age of 24, Coone was able to lay down an almost impossible feat; completely selling out one of Belgium's largest venues with over 10.000 Hard Dance fans for an exclusive event - Coone & the Gang. The event has certainly become one of Coone's most memorable moments, a clear pillar in his life which marked the beginning of big things to come and completely opened the Hard Dance scene in Belgium, boosted by national tv and media coverage.

As collaborations with some of Hardstyle's biggest names rolled in, Coone was able to impress the world with his unique sound within Hardstyle, imprinting a distinct signature sound into his productions. His experience has lead him towards a new "Challenge"; to create an album in 30 days including collaborations with some of the Hard Dance scene's superstars. The album was met with great support in the scene, catapulting Coone to new heights.

Coone's success within Europe has opened up many doors for him as his eyes are fixed on the horizon, towards the international Hardstyle scene in countries such as Australia and the United States. Without a doubt, Coone lives and breathes Hardstyle. His passion shared by thousands of like-minded souls all over the world, each speaking a universal language. Music. A binding force uniting us all.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Crystal Castles are an experimental electronic band formed in 2003 in Toronto, Ontario by songwriter/producer Ethan Kath. Crystal Castles are known for their chaotic live shows and lo-fi melancholic homemade productions. They released many limited vinyl singles between 2006 and 2007 before releasing a trilogy of critically acclaimed albums between 2008 and 2012.
In 2005 Ethan Kath released the digital singles "Magic Spells" and "Untrust Us" under the moniker Crystal Castles. As they grew popular online he began receiving offers from record labels. In 2006 Kath recruited vocalist Alice Glass for the band's first physical EP "Alice Practice" which was released on vinyl and sold out in 3 days.

Their debut album, Crystal Castles, was released in 2008 and was listed on NME's "Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade" list at No. 39. In 2010 their second album, titled (II), charted on the Billboard 200, and includes their first worldwide charting single, "Not In Love", featuring vocalist Robert Smith of The Cure. The album has received general acclaim and was placed on many 2010 top critics lists. Their third album, (III), was released on November 12, 2012 and was the number 1 album of 2012 on Tumblr and also on Hype Machine. The album included 4 singles: "Plague", "Wrath of God", "Sad Eyes" and "Affection".

Glass announced her departure from the band in October 2014, citing personal and professional reasons. In April 2015, Ethan Kath released a new Crystal Castles track, "Frail", featuring a new singer, Edith Frances. He also announced they are writing and recording a new album]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[If you’d spent the last few years of your life wrapped up in an album like Star Of Love, you’d go looking for a little respite, too. Crystal Fighters’ debut was the product of minds made manic by a deluge of fresh experience, both in the studio and on the road. It was inspired by an opera written by a man whose sanity disintegrated before he could finish it. It seemed to be influenced just as much by traditional Basque music from the 18th century as it was modern-day clubland, and contained residual traces of every genre, scene, style or party that had existed in-between.

But if album one was the sound of haywire electronic loops frantically kept spinning like plates on sticks, then album two is the story of Crystal Fighters mastering control of those rave repetitions, withdrawing from the chaos of the club to carve their music into the shape of songs. To write the album, Crystal Fighters retreated to the Basque hills that they consider to be their spiritual home. Their music has always born traces of the local sound –traditional instruments like txalapartas and txistus vying in the mix with razor’s edge guitars and percolating techno synths – but the purpose of this mission was different. Immersed in their creative cradle, they wanted to tap into something beyond their immediate experience, to uproot themselves from temporal bounds in order to write timeless songs.

These methods proved to be spectacularly successful – Crystal Fighters wrote Cave Rave in its entirety during this two-month spell. There followed a quick detour to Los Angeles to produce the tracks, but after this it was still the songs written in the Basque country that remained most audible – only now the melodies found there had been sharpened into hooks, songs exploded into towering anthems. This revelatory process also exposed the band to a new way of thinking: a realisation that even the cultures they considered traditional are comparatively new. The album draws deeper into universal, history-permeating themes of love, death, insanity and hope; using Basque culture as a stepping stone backward to the spiritual and primal.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On May 21, 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007. 

Initial public comments have since been positive. Daft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on November 19, 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. 

A music video for the single directed by Oliver Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. The highly anticipated original motion picture score for TRON: Legacy, composed and produced by Daft Punk, will be released by Walt Disney Records / EMI Music on Monday, December 6 2010.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Dash Berlin is a Dutch electronic music group created in 2007 by Jeffrey Sutorius, Eelke Kalberg and Sebastiaan Molijn. Jeffrey Sutorius, the face of Dash Berlin also represents it by himself. The front man of the group is the DJ Jeffrey Sutorius, the 10th most popular DJ in the world according to DJ Mag in 2013. Sutorius initially started playing drums influenced by his late father who was a drummer in a jazz band, before discovering electronic music. 

He worked at BPM Dance and Mid-Town Records specializing in vinyl, with both stores becoming meeting places for many established Dutch DJ's. Molijn and Kalberg, who were deejaying as Pronti & Kalmani at the time, have credited Sutorius as a vital source of inspiration for some of their biggest records during that time. Kalberg and Molijn have been contributing to the international dance scene for over ten years, with award-winning and platinum-selling hits for dance acts such as Alice Deejay, Vengaboys, Candee Jay, Pronti & Kalmani and Solid Sessions. 

Their track "Better Off Alone" was one of the first trance records that became big in the United States and was later sampled by French superstar DJ David Guetta in his song "Play Hard" and one of America's biggest rappers Wiz Khalifa in his breakthrough record "Say Yeah". They also have been working together with DJ Sander Kleinenberg on classic tracks like "This Is Miami" and "The Fruit" and remixes for major artists such as Justin Timberlake ('Rock Your Body' Remix winning the award for 'Best Remix' at the Dance Star USA Awards), Janet Jackson, BT, Usher, N.E.R.D., Lenny Kravitz, Junkie XL, Röyksopp, Mylo and Annie Lennox.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[With 2009’s multi-platinum One Love, two-time-Grammy-winning artist/producer/DJ David Guetta cemented his status as a genre-busting hitmaker whose in-your-face fusion of electro and hip-hop beautifully warps the pop landscape. Now, with his fifth studio album Nothing But The Beat, Guetta builds on that breakthrough momentum and takes his decades-spanning career to a frenetic new level marked by bigger hooks and more brain-bending beats. 

A star- packed powerhouse showcasing today’s hottest hip-hop and R&B artists, Nothing But The Beat backs up its high-gloss pop with ingenious electronic stylings that deftly flaunt Guetta’s DJ pedigree. In a nod to the driving force behind Guetta’s crossover success, the double album (due out August 29) also offers an all-instrumental disc designed to turn new listeners on to the hypnotic sound of house music.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Modest in his core, yet exceptionally passionate when it comes to performances and creating music, Adaro is unquestionably one of the most ambitious artists within the hardstyle scene. As a DJ, Adaro has the look and feel of a true entertainer – his undying energy and widespread knowledge of music are just some of his greatest assets on stage. After years of watching his biggest heroes behind the decks at clubs and huge indoor events, Thijs Ploegmakers, or better known as Adaro had a growing interest in not only listening to electronic music but also immersing himself in the world of production. 

Beginning his productions within other genres of dance music, Thijs then shifted his attention to hardstyle in 2008 which saw him working and collaborating regularly with Ran-D, resulting in their first release on A2 Records, “My Name Is Hardstyle” in 2009. Little did Thijs know that this first release would signify a life-time of achievements, an impressive and diverse discography, rewarding memories and several memorable performances… 

Adaro continued to pursue his own signature sound, which is a sound that has captivated thousands of fans around the world and has also inspired many budding producers. Adaro’s sound can be simply described as a sophisticated and atmospheric approach to hardstyle, blending in a range of different sounds and packing in and endless supply of energy! His hard beats are notorious for getting fans going on the dance-floor and his diverse and addictive sound has drawn in a remarkable number of listeners worldwide. 

Tracks such as “The Haunter of the Dark,” “Dark Universe,” with hardcore legend Rob Gee, his remix of “Answers” by Chain Reaction, “Open The Gates” with E-Force and MC Nolz have all had a huge impact on the hardstyle scene, subsequently securing Adaro’s name in a sacred position. Apart from his remarkable solo discography, Gunz For Hire classics including “Bolivia,” “Kings Of The Underground” and “Sorrow” have impacted fans worldwide and just go to show how incredibly diverse Adaro’s production skills are. 

Finding himself playing at some of the most prestigious parties such as Qlimax, Q-BASE, Mysteryland (The Netherlands), Intents Festival, Hard Bass, Decibel Outdoor Festival, Qlimax, Defqon.1 (Australia and The Netherlands) and also having the honour to host several nights and stages, Adaro has proved that consistency and approaching his projects with passion and dedication pays off.

Celebrating many milestone performances, moments and chart-topping hits throughout his career, Adaro hasn’t only impacted the lives of hardstyle fans in The Netherlands, but has also spread his sound to all corners of the globe. He’s had the honour to perform internationally several times in countries such as Australia, Chile, Spain, The United States, Germany, Scotland and many more. 

Apart from a performance schedule that’s packed to the brim and some more releases to add to his agenda, another huge development came about in 2015 that saw Adaro teaming up with a stellar team of artists to create something new and unique. Alongside B-Front, Frequencerz and Ran-D, the brand new label ‘Roughstate’ was established as a platform to represent high-quality and sophisticated hardstyle. Since its conception, the label has been a huge success and has become a platform that personally represents Adaro and what his music stands for. 

Working his way to become one of the leading names in the hardstyle scene, Adaro is recognised as the full-package entertainer. All pieces of the puzzle fit together, from his productions to his performances and image, Adaro isn’t just a DJ and producer, but an artistic innovator. He is the king of the underground…  The haunter of the dark who will hit you with that bang sh*t… He is Adaro…]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[DJ Tennis born in the 70's and raised between New Jersey, Sicily and Parma in a family who paid just a passing attention to music. No relatives played any musical instruments, nor were there any around the home - music was never given any special amount of love in the Romano household. But despite this, and perhaps as a direct result of this, Romano's creative and artistic attitude has always centred around music: singing, creating and collecting weird and noisy musical instruments at every turn. 

In 1988 before embarking on computer science studies he was already playing and singing in college bands and had an indie rock radio show on a local radio station in Palermo. Recording with bands, organising events and DJing at the local tennis club where he used to play semi-professionally (his DJ moniker comes from his passion for the sport) became his way to support the costs of his studies, though when he graduated he never imagined he would turn that hobby into his fully-fledged career. 

Whilst starting out as a DJ he began focusing on promoting new underground music in his country, founding and developing some of the most important Italian underground musical events such as the Elita festival in Milan and the Dissonanze festival in Rome - at the same time creating forward-thinking new promotional concepts around the Italian clubbing scene.

In the early 90s Romano also started producing music for theatre, movie soundtracks and TV commercials, his production skills always taking inspiration from the psychedelic, dark and melancholic sounds of the 60’s, thru to early 2000’s IDM. 

The range of influences paint a picture of his musical worldview: The Beach Boys, The Who, Talk Talk, Ultravox, XTC, Fugazi, June of 44, Suicide, Radiohead, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada and Plastikman – into every musical project he poured elements, sounds & feelings from all of these artists and many more. In 2010, after growing tired of the the more overtly generic output of the contemporary scene he decided to collect all of his musical works and, along with Thugfucker’s Greg Oreck, started a new techno and pop label called Life and Death. 

The name of the label has a specific meaning, inspired by the socratic method of the maieutic process to turn ‘dead’ elements into a new life, and referring to the hypnotic power of music used in the mesmeric processes for brain therapy. Life And Death was alive.

Romano bases himself in Berlin where he also shares the label experience and a studio with the innovative deep electronic duo Tale of Us, whilst he working hard to create a crew of young and inspired musicians like Clockwork and Esperanza, amongst others. On top of all of this he still maintains his main job is still being a Promoter and a Booking agent in 2012. He may go by the name Tennis but he continues to be a hugely talented all-rounder.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Hailing from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Ferry Corsten’s lustrous career is exemplified by a passion for music that began as a hobby and spiralled into a full-blown profession. Today, as it was in the beginning, Corsten’s skills lie in his ability to coax the maximum emotional impact from electronic dance music of all genres, not just trance, but also progressive-house and electro. He remains and has always been ahead-of-his time, making music that becomes a template for others to follow.

From the outset, Corsten has been a prolific music-maker. With seven full-length studio albums under his belt and multiple Gold records to his name with songs that include ‘Punk,’ ‘Out Of The Blue,’ ‘Rock Your Body Rock,’ and other world-class hits like ‘Made Of Love’ featuring Betsie Larkin, ‘Hyper Love’ Feat. Nat Dunn and ‘Radio Crash’, Ferry’s output has always been plentiful and diverse. None more so is this true then with collaboration and remix work that has seen Ferry line-up alongside star names from the world of pop, rock, electronic and hip hop in Justin Bieber, U2, Moby, Faithless, The Killers, William Orbit, Duran Duran and Public Enemy.

From his New World Punx project with fellow trance pioneer Markus Schulz to his FULL ON live show concept, whereby he melds different styles of dance music by playing back-to-back sets with his cherry-picked roster of DJ/producer friends and a state-of-the-art stage setup, through to his hotly anticipated new live show and tour concept ‘Ferry Corsten presents Gouryella’. Ferry has continued to push and excite the world with his live and DJ show experiences. A statement that has been felt everywhere from festivals in Tomorrowland, Creamfields, Dance Valley, EDC Las Vegas, clubs such as Amnesia, Space, Ministry of Sound, Avalon, and iconic arenas like Amsterdam’s Heineken Music Hall, Allphones Arena in Sydney and New York City’s Madison Square Garden.

Striving always for excellence, this is an artist who is never satisfied with all that he’s accomplished, instead always pushing for the next exciting idea. For Ferry Corsten, the possibilities are limitless.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Growing up in an artistic environment, with a musician, writer, and theater director for a father, Fox didn’t need much prodding to explore art from the inside-out. Laying down his tracks from scratch, he will also write and perform his own vocals. As a live musician, he is unafraid to pick up the guitar, drums, bass, or mix a live DJ set on stage. 

The casual listener is immediately struck by the emotional pith and complex narrative structures of his songs. Most dance song lyrics are throwaway, but Fox’s tracks are genuine, space-creating oddities of a new generation. They are indebted to the old singer-songwriters of the past, while also challenging traditional expectations for beat-based, electronic music. In a world that often prefers we choose ‘one or the other’, Fox is one of the few willing to balance and create a free-flowing tri-force of dance, pop, and rock in his music. 

A rare master of the live and digital, he is always experimenting and improving on his own structural artifices. “There is no best way,” he says, “that I would prefer to learn. When someone tries to tell me the ‘best’ way of compressing a snare, I prefer to learn it myself, because otherwise I would never try and go outside of that.” Keeping true to this spirit—to his own standards—he has been performing under the alias Fox Stevenson, reflecting his maturing growth as an artist, and culminating in the release of his first EP, Endless, with Firepower Records. 

Be on the lookout for Fox as he gets his music out to a wider audience, ups the ante with world-tours, produces in more sophisticated studios, and hosts a plethora of collaborations with other artists—as he tries simply, in his own words, “to be better and better.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[It all started when producer Pepijn began his quest, to search for a DJ better than the rest. Along his journey, he met Niels. They learned from one another, and became close friends. Their passion for Hardstyle grew stronger each day. Together, they formed the Frequencerz, and played chaotic sound waves wherever they went.

Their almighty power was sensed by two DJs - Deepack and D-Block & S-te-Fan. When Deepack played ‘Tomorrow and Beyond’ to close Defqon.1 2008, the Frequencerz knew they had hit the right note. Their drive to succeed had grown immensely, and they were eager to dominate enormous stages.
Since the beginning of their DJ carreer, they've performed at major events such as Defqon.1, Decibel Outdoor, Hard Bass, and many more.

            <description><![CDATA[Hardstyle DJ and producer Frontliner (Barry Drooger) is well known for his versatile approach to the genre. His latest album Producers Mind (2011) is a showcase of versatility and recent monster hits such as ‘Dream Dust’ and Lose ‘The Style’ are direct proof of his skills to both feel and surprise his fans. And while he normally makes his appearance high above the crowd, on just about every known mainstage, he is very much ‘one of the guys’.

This fueled thoughts for his 2012 campaign where he experiments with crowd fueled participation into his music, events and artist career. ‘For The People’ has that socialist charm while actually offering his fans and music enthusiast alike a chance to participate in his work as an artist and to even get something in return.

Frontliner’s career has been marked with success since he started in 2006, when he (at that time known as ‘Abject’) and Headhunterz joined forces to create two instant hits that were released under the Scantraxx Recordz Label; Scantraxx Rootz (2006) and End of my Existence (2006). From there he build on an impressive discography both as a solo artist and together with various fellow artists who were happy to work with his creative approach. ‘Spacer’ eventually became the most played hardstyle track of 2008 and can still be considered one of the most popular tracks in the genre.

Anthem wise Barry has become a popular name: ‘Save Exit Planet’ was the 2010 In Qontrol anthem, ‘Call Of The Visionary’ the theme for Reverze in 2011, ‘Never Come Down’ is the title of the 2012 edition of Emporium Festival and his latest track with Max Enforcer ‘On The Go’ is slowly becoming an anthem on itself. And with al this firework in recent years the magic word for the future can be easily guessed:

            <description><![CDATA[Meet Rob Black aka Girls Love DJs; A guy who’s been devastating dance floors for years with his non-stop evolving eclectic approach to dance music. After having wooed the Dutch crowds with the famous mc Ron Simpson at mega festivals like Mysteryland, Amsterdam Open Air, Kingsday Festival, We Are Electric and Valhalla, the Amsterdam based DJ and producer went on to impress the rest of the world and started building fan base on all different continents.

The year 2015 marks the spot of something exciting, as Girls Love DJs decided to launch a new imprint of it’s own titled Gum Pop Records. Named after the classic ‘bubblegum’ period of the 70s.

To inaugurate the label, the Gum Pop Records curator has produced the poppy single ‘EASY’, which is expected to be an international chart pusher!

But there’s more to Girls Love DJs then meets the eye. It’s actually a show that leads a legacy. Named after the much lauded parties and hostings at clubs and festival all over the world. The act showcases the same musical output and vibe as that of its parties, which started more then a decade ago.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Music maturity came swiftly for the now seasoned-veteran Robbert van de Corput, better known as Hardwell. At the age of 25, the young Dutch titan capped off a 10 year journey when he was crowned World’s #1 DJ in the 2013 DJ Mag Top 100 DJs Poll cementing his position as the electronic scenes newest superstar DJ and becoming the youngest ever winner of the coveted Top 100 DJs award. In 2014 the Dutch megastar did it again - being crowned World’s #1 DJ in the 2014 edition of DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs Poll for a second consecutive year.

Despite relinquishing his crown in 2015, though still taking the highly respectable second-place spot, it’s clear that Hardwell has already created a legacy that would put most of his counterparts to shame. This award-winning DJ, producer, musician, label owner and lover of all things music has not only helped shape the current state of EDM, but has left an everlasting imprint on it.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[There’s no ego, just music, when Jon Gaiser brings his live act to the club. Those who have met Gaiser will know he appreciates a good joke and an even better bass line. An avid producer with an arsenal of sounds at his disposal in the booth and inside the studio, it is no wonder that he has commandeered everyone’s attention.

Hailing from Grand Rapids, Michigan, Gaiser began his musical education studying percussion with the symphony and playing drums in punk rock bands. It quickly transitioned to techno when at the age of fifteen he discovered the endless possibilities of new sounds that only synths and drum machines could provide. Weekend forays into Detroit’s nightlife ultimately led him to move to the city and brought him in touch with the Minus crew. It was only a matter of time until some of Gaiser’s work fell into Richie Hawtin’s hands.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Jonas Kopp hails from Buenos Aires where he got his start at the young age of 19. After coming to our attention when Matthew Dear downloaded some of his tracks at an airport, we have been infatuated with his amazing production skills. Jonas creates an atmosphere of controlled chaos, a tension that owes some debt to his love for Detroit and Chicago classics. Jonas blew

the doors off with his hit “Espias Psiquicos (Jonas Kopp Psiquic mix)”, earning him an international audience including luminaries Adam Beyer, Sven Vath, Chris Liebing, Par Grindvik, and Pan Pot. He has recorded for Weave, 20/20 Vision and his home team Mindtrip music as well as founding Traut Muzik, a netlabel in which he curates the best techno artists from the argentine and global techno scene.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[If it’s music’s prerogative to change with the times, Laidback Luke is the master of evolution. The one time Chocolate Puma protégé turned Dance Music heavyweight has a two-decade track record of doing things his own way, keeping versatility at the core of his every move. He’s inspired the masses, rewired a worldwide passion for dance music and set a new precedent for fan interaction along the way. Add a who’s who list of collaborators, remixes, global live credentials and a side line in professional Kung Fu and there is still no rarer breed of superstar DJ than Laidback Luke. 

Since minting his debut release in 1995, Luke’s authority has only strengthened with the changing tides of dance music. Boasting collaborators to-date as varied as Diplo, Example, Lil Jon, Hardwell and Swedish House Mafia, his music shows a rare balance of both chart and credible club success. The wealth of remixes and personal bootlegs under his belt begs no exception, with credits ranging from Daft Punk, Green Velvet and Depeche Mode to Robin Thicke, Madonna and Mariah Carey. Adding house sideline Nouveau Yorican alongside wife and fellow DJ Gina Turner to the equation, his agenda continues to push boundaries and break norms at every given opportunity.

Passion project turned career altering label venture Mixmash Records has played a huge part in Luke’s overhaul of the music industry. A place where new music is discovered, nurtured and celebrated, the label has invested in the next generation of talent like few other of its time. With no formal musical agenda other than outright quality, the culmination of Mixmash and its Ones To Watch sub-label has unearthed stars, spotlighted next generation players and kept quality and creative energy at the forefront of this definitive career highlight. Avicii, Bingo Players, Knife Party, Afrojack and many others all credit Luke for his early support.

Beyond his recording career, the live arena is where the magic of Luke’s musical versatility is let loose. Spinning records from across the ages and keeping the ‘skill’ factor at the forefront of his live sets, this long and prosperous career behind the decks has seen no short cuts or technological loopholes from the long serving DJ. Through his Super You&Me concept, which to date has scaled the worldwide clubscene and has hosted a multitude of global festivals along the way, Luke and his army of prestigious peers continue to remind the world that the sound of a superstar does not waiver the right to have fun in the process. 

Launching into the New Year with a brand new residency at Wynn’s Surrender Nightclub and Encore Beach club in Las Vegas, the future has never looked brighter for the prolific Dutchman. The year ahead promises new music, fresh talent and an ongoing effort to invest in the future of electronic music at every possible turn. As enthusiastic as ever and with his activity engrained in the future of electronic dance music, Laidback Luke is still on hand to save the day one eclectic power move at a time.]]></description>

They made their way through Europe in a procession of caravans, as part of a vaudeville troupe they’d met in Spain. Wheeling into town after town, performing every night and practising in the day, My Baby learnt the art of performance. As sword-swallowing and knife throwing were not skills at which they excelled, they found in the mixing of their voices a magic that brought the rowdy audience of drunks and boisterous children under their spell.

            <description><![CDATA[Read, listen, or experience any of Nicky Romero’s interviews and you will hear one common phrase reiterate from the Dutchman’s mouth “Hard Work.” That core belief brought upon Nicky’s meteoric rise to international fame in a flourishing, yet oversaturated Electronic Dance Music market. At the age of 6, in the small town of Amerongen, Holland, Nicky Romero first discovered his innate talent for music as a drummer, specifically the snare, in his local marching band. From there, history unfolded in Nicky’s favor as he set himself on a course not only to fulfill his dreams of musical stardom, but as an all-encompassing DJ/Producer.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Noisecontrollers, born as Bas Oskam in the Netherlands, started producing the end of 2005 along with Arjan Terpstra. Arjan produced hip-hop and Bas was producing hardtrance. They decided to start producing hardstyle together and from that moment Noisecontrollers was born with only one goal: bringing hardstyle to a next level. In 2006 the response on their music was so great they decided to start a special live-act which they fired in 2007. Within 1 year they mostly played all through Europe, USA and Australia, on events like X-Qlusive, In Qontrol, Reverze, Hardbass, Qlimax and more.

Noisecontrollers before they split they released their music on Fusion Records, which started with "Creatures". After that, they got massive response on their second release containing "Crump", "Marlboro Man" and "Aliens".
In 2011 they created a label with Wildstylez called Digital Age. In November 2013 they decided to split up, and Bas Oskam continued the project, and Arjan Terpstra left to experiment with hard dance music. Their final events together were Qlimax 2013, on the 23rd of November 2013 and Clublife at Helsinki, Finland on the 21st of December 2013.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Original, emotional, visceral. These are all words that are used to describe Noisia’s music and each is more than justified. In less than a decade the Dutch trio, renowned for their unparalleled technical skill, has gone from releasing drum & bass on now defunct independent labels to crossing multiple genres, scoring for triple A video games, having their music used on trailers for Hollywood blockbusters and producing and remixing tracks for some of the world’s biggest artists. 

Working from their studio in their hometown of Groningen Nik Roos, Martijn Sonderen and Thijs de Vlieger have gradually developed and cultivated a sound that’s all their own; a sound that’s obsessed with production techniques; a sound that’s instantly recognisable whether you’re hearing three minutes of a Noisia track dropped at a festival or three hours of it while playing Devil May Cry 5. Having pushed the envelope and successfully managed to blend incredible sound design with unrelenting and uncompromising beats and basslines, Noisia’s sound is undoubtedly unique.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Matthias Paul better known by his stage name Paul van Dyk is a German Grammy-winning electronic music DJ, musician and record producer. One of the first true superstar DJs, Paul van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release Reflections. He was named the World's No. 1 DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something only few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named No. 1 by Mixmag in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide.

A trance producer starting in the early 1990s, Paul quickly achieved popularity with his remix of "Love Stimulation" by Humate on the record label MFS in 1993 and with his hit single "For an Angel" but, in recent times, he no longer likes to describe his music as trance, but rather simply as electronic music. Paul van Dyk is currently the radio host of "Vonyc Sessions with Paul" on Dash Radio.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In Europe, Psyko Punkz (known individually as Sven Sieperda and Wietse Amersfoort) need no introduction. The duo are among the top ‘Hardstyle’ purveyors across the Atlantic and are increasingly popular worldwide, thanks to their unique and hard-hitting take on the sub-genre of EDM that shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. “We’re pretty mainstream with a little raw edge on the top of it,” explains Wietse regarding Psyko Punkz’s explosive sound that has won over countless fans since they first burst onto the scene in 2008. 

“It’s been pretty crazy, but great,” the producer adds regarding the rise of the duo worldwide. Few could have anticipated what was in store for the Dutch duo when the two first met by chance at a party and discovered that they shared a mutual love and appreciation for electronic music, and more specifically, the Hardstyle genre. Upon joining forces, the two were quickly signed to the Belgian label, Dirty Workz, and they began performing live DJ sets at some of the largest and most well-known events in the EU, including Tomorrowland (where they will play for the fourth year in a row this summer), Qlimax, Hardbass, Decibel, Defqon.1 (NL and AUS) and Germany’s Nature One.

Truly Hardstyle in sound, image and lifestyle, Psyko Punkz’s reputation for energetic live sets has even won them shows far away from Europe, including stops across the U.S., Australia, Korea and the United Kingdom. “Our performance is always really energetic,” says Wietse, who calls Utrecht home. “Things can get crazy,” the Dutchman laughs regarding the growing and loyal fan base that turns up at live gigs, and outside observers have noticed just how many fans have latched onto the twosome, over the past three years especially. Tracks such as their “Psyko Foundation” and “Bass Boom” have won them an actual army of followers, nicknamed Psyko Soldiers. “Our fans are really dedicated….we have loads of fans with Psyko Punkz tattoos” adds Wietse.

And it’s not just the guys, either, attracted to the melodic yet pounding rhythms that typify a Psyko Punkz track. “Most people with tattoos are girls,” the DJ says, noting that goes against the stereotype of Hardstyle fans skewing male. In 2011 proof started to emerge of the duo’s growing influence, thanks to fans of all genders voting them into the prestigious DJ mag Top 100. They bowed at #78 that year, climbing to #67 in 2012. This year, expect the duo to rise even higher in the poll, thanks to the respect of fans and peers such as Headhunterz, all of whom have tipped the two as ones to watch. In fact, Psyko Punkz have collaborated with Headhunterz as well as other peers from Holland’s fast-emergent hardstyle scene. The pair worked with Noisecontrollers on tracks such as “Universe” and collaborated with Belgium’s Coone on cuts like “The Words.”

So what’s on tap for the future? For starters, they have released a new video of their new track Love This Life, the next one is in editing as we speaknew as well as an anticipated remix of Rank One’s classic dance track “Such Is Life.” Add to the mix some high profile festival appearances, including a stop at the inaugural edition of ID&T’s American debut via Tomorroworld in Georgia, and it’s safe to say Psyko Punkz’s legend will continue to grow far beyond Benelux...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[A London-based MC with Ghanaian heritage, Stormzy launched his career clashing at youth clubs around his hometown. His performances evolved from grime-only music that showed a love of artists like Skepta to more rap-oriented material that reflected Stormzy's growing appreciation for artists like Drake. Late in 2013 he began uploading his "Wicked Skengman" series of freestyles over classic grime beats; in 2014 he made his official debut with the EP Dreamers Disease. 

A year later he released the single "Know Me From" along with
"WickedSkengMan 4," the first track in his "WickedSkengMan" freestyle series and a Top 20 hit in the U.K. That December, Stormzy performed the single's B-side, "Shut Up," at a match between heavyweight boxers Anthony Joshua and Dillian Whyte. The song jumped into the Top 40 following the broadcast, and the rapper launched a campaign to have the song top the charts during Christmas. This boosted the track to the number eight position, and the number one position on the R&B singles chart. ~ David Jeffries, Rovi]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[People always ask if there is something in the water in Holland that makes this tiny country churn out so many prolific and successful DJs and producers. Seems there may be some credence to this  tale because we have another pair joining the ranks of the Dutch musical super elite. 

Welcome to the year of Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano! These two guys from Amsterdam met in 2006 in the clothing store where Sunnery worked, and where Ryan applied for an internship. While working together they noticed a lot of similar interests, and started working on some music together. From that moment on the two never stopped doing what they love most and they’ve created a big name for themselves since then. 

Axwell [SHM] said after playing with them in Ibiza that: “If there were a Dutch version of Swedish House Mafia, it would be Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano.” Impressive accolades for these relative  newcomers, who were plucked from their obscure retail jobs back in 2007. It seems their funky house and tribal sound struck a chord with partygoers and, after gaining popularity in their home country, these best friends took their electric energy worldwide. 

Sunnery and Ryan DJ sets are becoming the stuff of legend. With hair flopping and body rockin’, there is no time to sit on the sidelines at one of their shows. They embody dance music fully, bringing the crowd to epic peaks, arms in the air and smiles all around. It’s not a genre thing, it’s a music thing, and Sunnery and Ryan convey that passion to the dance floor in a way very few artists can. See them one time and you will understand. 

Breaking new ground performances that inspire and awaken the soul have brought the duo escalating successes across the globe. With their star on the rise, Sunnery and Ryan are now part of the superstar DJ set and tour circuit. Their diary reads like a massive global pilgrimage, and in a way, it is just that. A way to preach the gospel of house music, in all its vast forms, to a new generation of music lovers. From the USA to Mexico, Brazil to Guatemala, The Netherlands, The United Kingdom, Asia, Russia and all points in between, these two house music champions are breaking new ground one country at a 
time. 

Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano have quickly ascended into the upper echelon of dance music producers with the release of monster anthems like ‘Tribeca’ and their remake of Tiesto’s ‘Lethal Industry.’ Fans and tastemakers all have supported each Sunnery and Ryan release with the latter track being a weapon of choice for Armin van Buuren, Sander van Doorn, David Guetta and the list goes on and on. Even the don of EDM, Pete Tong made Lethal Industry his ‘Essential Selection’ not once, but twice! Steve Angello scooped up their tune ‘Markuzza’ (along with Traffic and Snitch) for his Size Records imprint realizing early on what a masterpiece it was. 

Ground breaking hits lead to remix work, and Sunnery and Ryan are the go to producers for some of dance music’s most respected artists. To date the boys have reworked tracks for Sander Kleinenberg (‘This Is Our Night’), Kaskade (‘Dynasty’) and Ferry Corsten’s (‘Ain’t No Stoppin’). With recent successful tracks such as 'Stiffness' with Chocolate Puma, 'Triton' with Dubvision (also the anthem for Dance Valley 2013) and 'Sound of The underground', a collaboration with Nicky Romero, got to the top 3 in Beatport’s Top 100, these two prove to be on top of the dance scene. Their latest release ‘Circus’ climbed up to #12 in Beatport’s Progressive House chart and will be a guaranteed club banger this spring. 

The Dutch superduo travels around the world and let huge crowds in awe. Gigs at Ultra Music Festival in Miami and Croatia, worldwide editions of Sensation, BPM Festival at Playa del Carmen in Mexico, Dance Valley and Mysteryland in homecountry The Netherlands, several Electric Daisy Carnivals, clubtours in Vegas, Chicago, New York and an own club night in club Booom on the island of Ibiza. Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano have seen it all. With a residency in world-renowned club Hakkasan in EDM mecca Las Vegas and their Essentials Mix on the highly popular radio station BBC Radio 1, 
2014 is starting off big. 

Sexy By Nature 
In March these two hosted their first own solo show ‘Sexy by Nature’ in Amsterdam’s Heineken Music Hall. This party started on Ibiza, where the two created the concept with ALDA Events. During their club nights in Ibiza they offered a chique, elegant and seductive evening. Now it was time for a bigger venue, a bigger crowd and more Sunnery and Ryan. With funky electro and latin sounds they showed the crowd that they’re witnessing something unique. Something only these 
guys can do. 

Here’s where we tell you that Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano are the next big thing, headed to #1 and all that bio fluff. The thing about great artists is this, they don’t need words on paper hyping their sound because the only thing that matters is how they make you feel when they play.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Widely recognized as the originator of the ‘Dirty House’ movement, Vato Gonzalez has won thousands of fans over the last few years with his immensely energetic stage presence, rebellious attitude and by generally doing things his way. Vato’s big break came in 2007, when he unleashed the first ‘Dirty House’ mixtape to the public. The fast-paced mixing proved to be an instant hit with the crowd and spread like wildfire all over the internet, resulting in more than 150.000 downloads.

Quickly after the launch of the first mixtape, Vato started with ‘Dirty House’ events and as the brand/movement grew, he sold out clubs with his ‘Dirty House’ concept, hosting ‘Dirty House’ arenas at massive events becoming one of the main festival attractions in Holland. As the poster boy for DIY artists, Vato also set up his own booking agency ‘010 Bookings’ and ‘Dirty House’ record label to become completely independent. As demand grew for ‘Dirty House’, he rolled out four additional mixtapes over the next 3 years, amassing well over a million downloads.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Yves Deruyter started his DJ career in 1985 and played in famous Belgian clubs such as, Globe, Barocci, Cherrymoon, Illusion, Extreme, Carat, BBC, La Rocca and many more. He then embarked on a career in production in 1991.

Signing with Lightning Records his first single Animals released on Bonzai Records became a big club hit in Belgium. The success of his first track led to requests for him to play at all the big rave parties such as May Day, Energy, Love Parade, Street Parade, Nature One, Trance Energy, Mysteryland, Inner City, Sensation Black, Dance Valley, Groundzero, Frequence, Decibel Outdoor, Defcon, Gatecrasher, I love Techno, Antwerp is Burning, City Parade, Tomorrowland and many more.

Yves second single Rave City made a big jump into the German market and became a big success with more than 50.000 units sold. The follow up Calling Earth was again a success with 70.000 units sold. All this was the start of a successful story and A Story About House was to be the next Cherrymoon Trax single, but due to problems with the club it was changed into a new Yves Deruyter single. Nevertheless his follow up single, The Rebel, was immediately signed all over the world. The Rebel was a massive club tune and an international breakthrough for Yves. This single was also the announcement for his first album D-Album containing all the singles from past and showcasing his production skills for future releases. During this period he started to produce under Cherrymoon Trax with friends and partners from the Cherrymoon club where he was playing. Four Cherrymoon Trax singles followed starting with The House of House which was a huge success, the last single In My Electric House was again successful in Germany. All this led to the first 3D black and white video made by Frank Dewulf who became an important artist with his B-Sides releases. 

Yves Deruyter's vision of his future in music is and will always be the same, making music for the people. For him it is important that people have fun while they're listening/dancing to his music. In the past he used to work with Frederico Santini, Dirk M.I.K.E. Dierickx (Push, The Blackmaster, M.I.KE., Moon Project, ...). The single Rhythmic Bazz was released in June 2001, this single was taken of the album 2001 as well as Back to Earth. The follow-up single was Music-Nonstop, which also got a remix-package with remixes from Ton TB (Three Drives) and others. These releases have played a huge part in the trance club scene and have helped shape many careers in EDM.

Spiritual Feeling/Y.D.O.T., done pretty well all over Europe. And a re-release of Spiritual Feeling, which will also includes a Dolphin remix made with his friend Laurent Veronnez, also done well.

Yves awesome cover of Underworlds classic Born Slippy continues to be a hugely memorable track. The single Infinity followed and was picked up by a lot of compilations, radio shows and DJ's alike. Yves Deruyter is a very hard working DJ, regularly traveling Europe this man is in high demand for his skills. Yves has mixed and produced many compilations himself including mega mixes for Bonzai Records and a Timeless Trance CD also. Yves also found himself helping with the running of Banshee Worx alongside his long term friends and partners.

You will be sure to catch Yves somewhere around Europe during some weekend, unless he is having a little time off which doesn't happen very often.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Dirty melancholic house music is the produce of much musical soul searching for emerging Norwegian star Finnebassen. Leaving his teenage genre hopping days behind him, 2008 saw a house music epiphany, as a deep rooted interest in electronic music began, bringing Finnebassen to the sound he relays today. Although he has been producing music and playing gigs in his hometown of Oslo for a long time, 2012 has finally seen the first attacks of Finnebassen on the worldwide electronic music scene, in both performance and production. UK label Electronique, took hold of his own production ‘If You Only Knew’ and provided remixes by Matt Fear, The Mekanism and Balcazar & Sordo. The original was seen prior to the full EP release and reached number 3 on the Beatport Nu Disco Chart.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Franky Rizardo’s hugely refreshing approach to house music has been paying dividends in a big way. Having established himself as one of the biggest draws in Holland’s house music circuit with a style that works as well on big stages as it does in sweaty clubs, he’s now rapidly expanding his horizons across the world. Releases on OFF, Defected and Spinnin’ demonstrate an increasingly strong production career, while his Flow radio show and events are fast becoming a major part of the house music landscape across the world.

“I think that playing a lot of different stages has taught me how to work with a large diversity of crowd, rather than doing one trick every show. I don’t want to be a one-trick pony. I just want to arrive and do my set specifically for that night.” It speaks volumes about his appeal and ambition that he’s as at home playing with long-time friend Hardwell as he is playing alongside house music legends like MK and Dennis Ferrer. 

A decision to dedicate himself to the modern deep house sound in recent times stemmed from a desire to stop his style from snowballing to the OTT builds and drops that his main stage and big room performances were pressuring him towards. "I was performing on the big stages and I thought, I’m really enjoying the big crowd, but I’m really not enjoying being pressured towards a certain sound. So I thought to myself - how can i bring my house sound to these crowds?"]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Ricardo Rodrigues is the kind of artist that’s best described as ‘self-made’. His road to success took him from his birth town Lisbon, all the way to Holland, and then to Barcelona. Recently he felt it was time to return to his roots, and set up Industrialyzer’s headquarters in Amsterdam, the capital of the country where he truly discovered Techno, raves, and everything that makes people fall in love with this scene.

Getting his name on the bill of the events he plays today has not been an easy job. Because Ricardo plays and produces the kind of uncompromising electronic music he does, it’s been a struggle to compete with rapidly changing trends, and the fickle mistress that is the electronic music industry. Let’s be fair, if in the last decade you weren’t willing to diverge to House, Minimal, or some other fashionable sub genre to please the whims of the crowd, you probably didn’t have an easy time making your way.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Norman Quentin Cook also known by his stage name Fatboy Slim, is an English DJ, musician and record producer/mixer. As a solo electronic act, he has won ten MTV Video Music Awards and two Brit Awards. His records as Fatboy Slim also helped to popularise the big beat genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s.

Cook first rose to fame in the 1980s as the bassist of the indie rock band The Housemartins who scored a UK number-one single with their a capella cover of Isley-Jasper-Isley's "Caravan of Love". After the band split, Cook formed Beats International whose début album spawned their signature hit, "Dub Be Good to Me" which was another UK number-one as well as going on to become the seventh best-selling single of 1990 in the UK. 

Cook then went on to join numerous other acts including Freak Power, Pizzaman and The Mighty Dub Katz to moderate success. Cook adopted the Fatboy Slim moniker in 1996 and released Better Living Through Chemistry to critical acclaim. Follow-ups You've Come a Long Way, Baby and Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, as well as their associated singles, including "The Rockafeller Skank", "Praise You", "Right Here Right Now", and "Weapon of Choice", were also met with positive reviews and commercial success.

In 2008, Cook founded a project called The Brighton Port Authority. Cook has been responsible for successful remixes for Cornershop, Beastie Boys, A Tribe Called Quest, Groove Armada, and Wildchild.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Over The Top is one way to describe the Scooter charts history both at home and abroad, earning them the accolade of Germany’s most successful chart act since records began. Even though the news of their #1 album in the UK rankings has long since penetrated the media world, causing considerable amazement in some quarters, the SCOOTER crew appear relatively underwhelmed by the whole phenomenon. Which seems to be the ideal strategy for maintaining their high altitude flight, beyond the reach of any radar wave interference. 

In total, Scooter can look back on more than 400 weeks (and counting) in the German charts, the equivalent of eight years, pretty much half of Scooter’s 16 year band history to date. Scooter are one of a very few German acts to have shaped the musical landscape at home and abroad for well over a decade, without losing any of their energy or freshness. You either love Scooter or you hate them – either way, their style is the antithesis of boring! Over 30 million sales and more than 80 gold and platinum awards all over the globe underline their extra-special status.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Having enjoyed a breathlessly successful 2015, there can be no doubting Alan Fitzpatrick’s position as one of the most influential electronic artists of the moment. Pumped up by yet another series of head-turning productions over the previous twelve months, the Englishman’s profile continues to transition rapidly from the techno underground towards the electronic music main stage , attracting significant attention from BBC Radio 1, Mixmag and Resident Advisor and elevating Fitzpatrick to the position of global headliner. A status supported by the release of Fitzpatrick’s Fabric 87 mix compilation in April 2016 and the accompanying 25-date tour that will roll out across Europe before touching down in North and South America.

Already a universally respected and in-demand producer, Fitzpatrick has succeeded in carving out his own musical niche within the ever-expanding genre of techno, earning him the reputation of a seemingly unstoppable source of hit music. Tracks such as ‘Love Siren’, ‘Truant’, ‘Skeksis, ‘For An Endless Night’, ‘Always Something For Nothing’ and ‘Reflections’ (a BBC Radio 1 Essential New Tune) have all topped sales charts since 2009, drawing high praise from peers and tastemakers across genre divides for the vibrancy, originality and inventiveness that has come to characterise Alan Fitzpatrick’s music. Whether he is adding diva vocals to cavernous beat workouts, fusing emotive chord sequences with trademark heavy-funk grooves, blending jungle beats and hardcore bass lines with barnstorming techno dynamics, or conjuring up sumptuous low-slung soundscapes; Alan Fitzpatrick knows how to move your mind, body and soul by delivering tracks that stand out from the norm.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Wherever you find Ellen Allien, you find movement. Born in Berlin, living and working in Berlin and Ibiza, one of the planet’s most dynamic party scenes, her artistic home stands for one thing above all: freedom, in every aspect. DJ, musician, label manager, t-shirt designer and creative all-rounder – Ellen Allien has carved out her own space in all these roles, creating a unique universe. Since 1999 she has managed the label BPitch Control in Berlin, as well as the t-shirt range ellen allien. As a DJ she rocks clubs and festivals all around the world. She is a resident at DC10/ Ibiza, Nitsa/ Barcelona / watergate berlin as well as at major festivals such as Melt/ Germany and Name/ France and tours worldwide with BPitch Control events. Her productions have even been performed at temples of modern art such as the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

She is constantly exploring new aural worlds, most recently on her soundtrack album "LISm" (2013), her works “Dust” (2010) and “Sool” (2008) or in collaboration with Apparat in 2006 on “Orchestra Of Bubbles”. Or like her upcoming EP "High" (2015) or recent EPs "Ellen Allien RMX" (2015), "Freak" (2014), "Free Nation" (2014) with Thomas Muller or the 12" like "GO" (2007), "Pump" (2010) und " The Kiss" (2011).

For a long time now, Ellen Allien has been regarded as a fixed star in the electronic music galaxy. She is an extraordinary creature, a one-of-a-kind artist without whom Berlin’s vibrant electronic club landscape wouldn’t be the same. Fortunately someone thought of a suitably extraterrestrial name for her right at the start of her career: Allien. No name will ever suit her better.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Whether it’s producing, remixing or dj’ing, Sander Kleinenberg has been building credibility in on all fronts for over two decades. With twenty years of experience behind him, he’s established himself as an advocate for progress and most of all, a pivotal player on the frontier of electronic music. Starting out at merely fifteen years old, a young Sander Kleinenberg was inspired by R&B and hip-hop culture in the late eighties. These urban vibes led to him starting his own career, which in turn led to him traveling the world and spreading his sound along the way.

Often mentioned when talking about the first wave of superstart dj’s from more than a decade ago, Sander brought a mixture genres and styles to the table like never seen before. His quirky disco, psychedelia, Detroit techno, straight up soul and industrialism contributed greatly to the ever-evolving musical landscape in the ‘90s and 00’s. Sander’s eclectic persona and capability to always be two steps ahead of the rest have resulted in him being an award-winning dj and producer. As time passes by and his career unfolds, the pattern within it becomes more and more visible, Sander is ‘a man on the move, always searching for the perfect mix’ in his own words]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[“In a way, for people to fully understand my music, they need to know the narrative of the last six years of my life,” says Porter Robinson, of the leap he’s made from electro-house producer to genre-busting musician. 

That music can be heard on his first studio album, Worlds (Astralwerks/Virgin EMI), a journey through textural synth-pop. It has, at turns, been called “gorgeous” (New York Times), “delightful” (Rolling Stone), and “imaginative” (NPR). And with more than 185 million album streams under his belt, 100,000+ in ticket sales for his 2014 Worlds Live tour, plus triumphant headline appearances across the global festival circuit with his groundbreaking live show; Porter’s fans have stood by him in kind. Some, admittedly, more emphatically than others.

“I see people getting tattoos of my logo, my lyrics, my signature now!” Porter marvels. “It’s very high praise, for sure. It’s not something that you can prepare yourself for.” Although Porter dropped Worlds as a confident artistic statement, he honestly wasn’t sure if even his most devoted supporters would see his vision. “The praise has been vindicating,” he says, relieved. “I expected more resistance from my fans in terms of keeping a certain sound. But they fully embraced this.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[By combining sound and force with weight, the Bassnectar experience engulfs the senses. The experience of Bassnectar is more visceral than auditory, as the music sets any stage for an adventure without rules or limitations. On Bassnectar's stage, there is no hesitation in fusing the familiar with the strange or the classic with the cutting edge.

Bassnectar is the brainchild of Lorin Ashton, and his open-sourced musical project is as diverse as it is imaginary, as raw as it is meticulous, and as fierce as it is stunning. Spanning the spectrum of sonic style, the music draws inspiration from every genre imaginable and supplies a synthesis of intense, wobbling basslines and hypnotic soundscapes for a devout international audience that desires the beautiful and the bestial in the same breath.

In whatever medium Bassnectar works, music is the lure and social impact is the sincere intention. According to Ashton, “We are so blessed, and so deeply fortunate to be alive and awake right now…it’s a basic truth, but it’s very powerful. I think privilege confers responsibility, and Bassnectar is a reflection of that opportunity to give back; the motion of my cells bouncing back at the world.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Leipzig has always been a decent stamping ground for electronic music and Berlin is within easy reach. Lexer’s booking agency is based in the capital, inundated with requests over the past couple of years, catalyzing Lexer to the status of zealous club tourist (for all the right reasons). Anyone who has had the pleasure to hear and see a Lexer set in the flesh is sure to have found himself or herself amidst a crowd of smiling faces and ecstatic dancers. He takes them by the hand, communicating with them through his music, effortlessly infusing them with a warm and happy glow. 

Joining the dots between new and old in his own inimitable way. Things took off two years ago with an edit he made of the Band Of Horses track “Funeral”. Edits and remixes of songs from atypical genres are integral to his DJ sets. At the end of the day, the only distinction that matters is the one between good and bad, music which moves you and music which doesn’t.
What better format to gather all these golden threads together than an album? One which tells Lexer’s story, taking the listener on a journey.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Growing up to a backdrop of deep house music, DJ and producer Prunk was destined for a future behind the decks. His most memorable encounter with this sound is receiving an Ian Pooley record from his older brother on his 11th birthday. Of this moment he says: "My brother already knew at that time that I could understand and feel house music. From that moment on, I fell in love with it." A few years later Prunk started to mix records and dropped his first set on the internet.

Sounds like Todd Terry, Moodymann, Dimitri from Paris and Blaze were pumping out of the speakers in his little attic.
A the age of 16, Prunk found himself increasingly more attracted to deep and jackin' sounds. The US house sound, particularly that of Mark Farina, was already one of his favourites, but he continued his search for the deeper and better beats the international house scene had to offer. His quest for this particular sound introduced him to artists like Kerri Chandler, Derrick Carter,Brett Johnson, Dixon and DJ Sneak.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Luke Slater is a rare phenomenon in electronic music: he is someone who has helped define and redefine the techno genre throughout a number of decades. Starting out in the ‘90s, twenty years later it is no exaggeration to say he is as relevant and exciting as ever before. His gig schedule and discography stand as proud testament to that. 

Meanwhile, the music he releases under a number of respected guises is just as critically acclaimed, mainly releasing his music these days on the Berlin label Ostgut Ton and his own Mote-Evolver. It all started in the nineties with four landmark albums as Planetary Assault Systems. They came on the influential Peacefrog label and announced Slater as a master of dynamic, futurist techno. The likes of Freek Funk and Wireless followed on NovaMute, both of which were albums that continued to tread new techno territory, with stretched ambient textures, hypnotic rhythm frameworks and a real underlying narrative tying them all together. 

At the same time, cult Fear of Loathing mixes for React and the long-running fabric series came as proof of Slater’s DJing abilities, too, chopping up and stitching together sleek and deep minimalism with more organic techno like few had before or since. After a period away from the spotlight, 2009 saw Slater return right to the vanguard.

It was with the Temporary Suspension album under his most influential guise, Planetary Assault Systems, and came on Ostgut Ton, the most influential label of the day. The record heralded a return - for Slater and the wider scene - to some of the traditional, purist values of early techno. Consider it with follow-up The Messenger on the same label and you have two of the finest electronic albums of recent years: they combine moments of serenity with frictionless grooves and more brutalist workouts that always supersede the usual ‘techno tool’ blueprint.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[De Dijk (The Dike) is a Dutch rock band which formed in 1981. The band is named after Zeedijk, a street in their hometown Amsterdam. Their music can be described as a mixture of soul, blues and rock 'n roll, with lyrics sung only in Dutch, except for their 2010 album Hold on Tight and the song 'Enough is Enough', both of which are sung in English by Solomon Burke. They are considered as one of the most important Dutch acts of the past 25 years.

De Dijk was formed by Huub van der Lubbe, who also is an actor and poet, his brother Hans van der Lubbe and Nico Arzbach. The band started in a time when Dutch language pop music became highly popular, with bands like Doe Maar, Het Goede Doel and Toontje Lager. Van der Lubbe performs as a poet as well. Perhaps as a consequence, the band is not only popular with teenagers but also with older people. During the 1990s, songs of De Dijk were a major source of inspiration for upcoming Dutch bands like Van Dik Hout and Bløf.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Italian DJ/ Producer Amnesys was born in 1987, but his parents called him Dario from day one. Just ten years old, he discovered hardcore when he got a compilation of A Nightmare in Rotterdam 5. From that day, all the innocence was blown away. Dario started to listen to hardcore more and more and became curious how all of his favourite records were produced. He started making music as well and after years of hard work, he delivered his first piece of art on Impulse Records. “The Ultimate Motherfucker”, which is still being played up to this day. These three tracks were also noticed by the Stunned Guys. Maxx and Giangy scouted the talented youngster and after two EP’s on Impulse Records, he was ready for the big job: releasing an EP on Traxtorm Records]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Angerfist is the world’s leading hardcore act, underlined by the fact that he received the prestigious 37th spot in DJ Mag's Top 100 DJ edition of 2014. Being the first hardcore artist ever to hit the chart. Angerfist was founded in 2001, when he dropped his first EP on Overload Records, the former sublabel of Masters of Hardcore Records. After that EP, he has produced an impressive continuous streak of hit records on Masters of Hardcore. Danny Masseling has produced three albums: “Pissin’ Razorbladez’”, “Mutilate” and “Retaliate” were released in 2006, 2008 and 2011. 

The albums had a huge impact on the scene and the development of hardcore music wise, especially in the last few years: Angerfist is the only artist to have four consecutive #1 hits on the annual MOH Hardcore Top 100 with "The Voice Of Mayhem (vs Outblast & MC Tha Watcher)" in 2010, "Incoming" in 2011, "Catastrophe (vs Outblast & MC Tha Watcher)" in 2012 and the destructive "Street Fighter" slammer in 2013. Next to the Angerfist project, Danny Masseling also produces records under the monikers of Kid Morbid, Bloodcage and Menace II Society.

Besides the music, Angerfist is known for the unique live-performances dressed in hooded sweater and wearing the infamous Jason-mask while performing all over the world. Bringin the grimy beats to every continent, Angerfist is selling out virtually every venue. With an unstoppable drive to spread the hardcore virus, he is destined for a long future of destructive beats. Three words to describe Angerfist? Retaliate and devastate!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Two passionate music lovers, one ambition and non-stop perseverance and dedication are just a few key ingredients that construct one of the fastest rising acts in the hardstyle scene, Audiotricz. The two masterminds behind the act, Leon Benschop and Kenneth Kroes grew up with a strong friendship and also a shared passion for listening to and producing music. 

With both boys having a solid background in sound design within other genres of electronic dance music, their sole focus shifted to hardstyle which has seen them embarking on an exciting and memorable journey to the top. After signing to Scantraxx Recordz in 2013, their career kicked off at a lightning bolt pace when their remix with Atmozfears for “Sparks” by Fedde Le Grand and Nicky Romero was dropped. The impact that this modern classic had on the hardstyle scene was incredible and it marked a massive breakthrough for Audiotricz. Their productions only continued to flourish and a plethora of astounding new music flowed with some chart topping hits such as “Infinite,” “Reawakening” with Atmozfears, “Ghettoblaster” with TNT and “Momentum” with John Harris.

This duo’s sound can be best described as a combination between melodic storylines, huge atmospheres and the ultimate party vibe. It’s no surprise to find their addictive melodies stuck in your head for days on end! With a handful of memorable experiences and an exponentially growing fan-base so early on in their career, Audiotricz kept persistent with releasing top-notch music and bringing their 100% energy to every performance which evidently led them to continue reaching incredible heights. 

2015 has been an unforgettable year for the duo and milestone performances at Hard Bass, EDC Las Vegas, Basscon presents: Resurgence, Intents Festival, WiSH Outdoor and Noisecontrollers: All Around Australian tour have proved that Audiotricz are on their way to the top. With a performance schedule that’s packed to the brim, a recognisable signature sound and a vast selection of releases up their sleeves, the future is set to be huge for Audiotricz who are dedicated to carry on their ‘infinite’ journey…]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Armed with an unmatched ear for kicks and a passion for hardstyle that began during his early childhood, B-Front has continuously challenged hardstyle music norms throughout the years. For the Dutch producer, what started out as a basement hobby quickly became a full-fledged career in one of the most competitive sectors of the music industry. It hasn’t come easily, but then again, success on the scale that B-Front has managed to achieve usually takes years of hard work and perseverance.

The results, however, have been astronomical. Now considered a major pioneer within the hardstyle community, B-Front has come a long way since his days curating house parties and local raves. His forward-thinking production style and knack for creating dark, sonorous soundscapes has won the support of artists such as Digital Punk, Ran-D, Titan, Alpha2, Frontliner and Adaro (to name a few). In 2006, his chart-topping hit “Lunatick” put him on the radar of many industry heavyweights and helped launch what would prove to be a straight run of successful releases.

As a DJ, it was getting to headline festivals such as Defqon.1 Festival, Loudness, Mysteryland, Hard Bass and Thrillogy that turned B-Front into a household name within the global hardstyle scene. His work as part of the Fusion Records family is unprecedented within his musical niche, and he credits the label for having helped him develop his art and his musical trademark. He currently enjoys a residency at the legendary Dutch event ‘Loudness’ and is frequently involved with a variety of emerging independent labels. His primary motivator as an artist remains the same as when he first discovered his love for beats.

“I followed my heart...I used to sit in my bedroom imagining what it would be like to DJ big events. It’s a cool thing to watch a dream like that become a reality.”

He experimented with several styles of music like techno, hardtrance and techtrance, before focussing on hardstyle and establishing his own universal sound. Hardstyle is not only about the quality of beats; the songs, melodies and vocals are also important elements of the evolution of the genre. Brennan Heart is a pioneer with this sound; with a track like 'Just as Easy', he started a new episode for hardstyle music and opened the door to a new audience. He's also a pioneer for exploring new territories and cities, bringing him all over the world to serve his worldwide fanbase.

            <description><![CDATA[Da Tweekaz, also known as Kenth Kvien and Marcus Nordli, are a Norwegian Hardstyle duo signed to Dirty Workz. Down to earth guys, with a passion for Hardstyle and Hard Dance in general, they give every crowd a moment to remember. When not behind the decks or in the studio, you can probably catch them partying in the front with their fans. 

Behind the decks their energy is unlike any other. Sunglasses on, smiles from ear to ear and fists pumping to each beat, they're a true spark to energize any party. From the personal setting of a club to the vast and immense setting of a festival, they bring their unique style to the table with an undying passion.

Besides their ever popular debut album "Time 2 Shine" which scored massive hits in Hard Dance charts worldwide, another major step in their career was moving away from their Norwegian roots and planting themselves firmly in Belgium, where they now reside. This makes an accessible means for bookings in the Hardstyle dense countries surrounding Belgium. Since in Belgium, Da Tweekaz have realized the high demand of fresh music from their fans, which made them come up with the concept of #Tweekay14 in 2014: they released one video clip and track each month throughout the whole year. 

Because of the big success of this concept, they decided to bring it back in 2016. #Tweekay16 is now in full force, bringing their fans new and unique sounds each month. If you're not already entranced by this duo, make sure you check their performance when you have the chance. It's unique, it's whacky and it's down-right fun! If you find yourself in the crowd at one of their performances, be sure to party in the front! You might even catch one of their limited]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Darkraver, born on the 12th of September 1967 and known at The Hague’s city hall as Stefan André Sweet, can be seen as one of the most mystical, most legendary and most entertaining artists in the scene as we know it today. An artist who doesn’t take himself too seriously, having one mission and one mission only: turning every single gig into an experience never to be forgotten by the attending audience. With main ingredients such as gallons of booze (Bacardi & coke please), voluptuous women (preferably naked), total chaos, wicked outfits and his unique taste of humour, this man can single handily turn any ordinary party into a páááárrtttyyy! 

But all fun and jokes aside, let us not forget where the brand “The Darkraver” also stands for: a highly skilled DJ with fantastic mixing techniques, with an impeccable choice of records to go with it. This combination of entertainment and skills has proved to be an enormous success and made him by far one of the most booked artists of all times, delivering him a huge - and ever growing - fan base.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[From a powerful and fervent performance on stage right down to a sophisticated and driven approach to production, Rene de Bruijn, or better known as Digital Punk is unquestionably the totality of a born entertainer. Putting in the hard yards to cement his name in a pioneering position, Digital Punk has heavily influenced a new wave in raw hardstyle and his legacy has served as an inspiration to budding producers and fans on all corners of the globe… This A2 Records superstar has experienced a prosperous career in music filled with milestone performances at Dominator, Intents Festival, Reverze, Q-BASE, the mainstage of Defqon.1 and Supremacy, where he stole the night by entering the crowd in a hovering booth whilst simultaneously dropping his stellar anthem “Supreme” feat. MC Nolz.

Throughout his vast collection of music, Digital Punk’s signature sound can be described as a sophisticated blend of raw atmospheres, face melting screeches, hard kicks and a relentless, undying energy that can kick any party into overdrive! Standout hits such as “Firestorm”, “Natural Born Killers” and “Everyday” alongside Adaro, “Born To Die” and “Rebel To The Grave” with Ran-D, “We Don’t Give A F*ck” with Frequencerz and MC Nolz, and his remix of “The Black Demon” by Radical Redemption showcased a unique and high-energy approach to hardstyle, yet still retained a remarkable production quality, which in turn established Digital Punk’s name as a raw hardstyle pioneer.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Isaac is at the forefront of harder dance music; a position he now holds for over 20 years. Always sticking his head out for new revolutions in sound. Roel Schutrups can be considered as one of the founders of Hardstyle. This background and his continuing efforts in the studio make him a regular headliner at the world’s biggest dance festivals and events like Electric Daisy Carnival (300.000 visitors), Defqon.1 Festival (40.000 visitors), Qlimax (28.000) and Decibel Outdoor (35.000). 
Still Isaac’s own focus has always been an international career which ultimately brought him everywhere in the world including U.S.A., Colombia, Australia, Japan, Chile, Russia, Canada and South Africa. 

As a producer it is very clear that Isaac has been influenced by many different styles of music; besides harder dance styles. Isaac has been very successful with various trance projects including Alice Deejay. This particular project reached gold and platinum album sales all over the world, something he would later do again with hardstyle anthems ‘On The Edge’ and ‘Go Insane’. The latter can be considered as the international break through of this sound igniting artists worldwide to follow and build a harder dance scene. Other renowned artists quickly found their way to his studio and Isaac soon remixed tracks for Dash Berlin, Martin Garrix, Showtek and Yellow Claw.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In 1987, his career as a DJ started when he was hired as a Struppier at Rotterdam Discothèque Bluetiek-Inn. Here he played with the Dutch House music pioneer Peter Slaghuis. Around this time he also hooked up with Rob Fabrie and Richard van Naamen to form Holy Noise, with whom he released a string of releases at the Hithouse record label (owned by Slaghuis). In 1991 Holy Noise had their biggest success with their release James Brown is Still Alive. This release was a reply to the popular house record James Brown is Dead by L.A. Style. In 1992 Elstak created his own record label, Rotterdam Records (under the flag of Mid-Town records) to release hardcore and Rotterdam Tekno. The first release on this label was a Holy Noise release under the guise of De Euromasters, releasing Amsterdam Waar Lech Dat Dan? (Translated; Amsterdam where is that?). 

This record was an implicit complaint about the Dutch media paying most attention to Amsterdam and not to Rotterdam. In 1995 he released the first DJ Paul Elstak single, Life Is Like a Dance. After this record, a few commercial releases followed. Rainbow in the Sky was the most successful of these. Several of his singles reached the Dutch Top 40 in the mid-1990s. After two years, Elstak decided to leave the commercial dance scene and devote his time releasing gabber. In 2001 he left Mid-Town and Rotterdam Records to start a new record label at Rige Entertainment, called Offensive Records. To this day Paul still releases hardcore on this imprint in his own typical style.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Teaming up in their hometown, Vlaardingen, in 2004, Mitchell Vreeswijk and Jan Stadhouders formed LNY TNZ with the shared passion of putting a new twist on hard hitting EDM. The group rapidly made a name for themselves, as they released underground tracks that evolved the genre into something entirely in and of its own.

They quickly became pioneers in Dutch music as a DJ tandem, known for their unique sound. Support from other leading artists came pouring in as LNY TNZ tracks appeared on numerous compilation CDs and received radio play worldwide. After mixing their second official compilation CD in 2007, LNY TNZ toured at major festivals and events around the globe, emerging as a leader in the scene.

Following a string of tours, Mitchell and Jan took a break to study, travel, and work on other art forms, including film directing. In 2012, they came up with a new round of music. LNY TNZ recorded several underground bootlegs and released them online to the support of their fans and major artists, who welcomed the duo back from hiatus]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The name ‘Partyraiser’ appeals to the imagination of any hardcore head. Fast, driven by pure energy and harder than the rest, or as he calls it: “party in een zaagjas.” Though impossible to translate, everyone who has ever witnessed a DJ set by Partyraiser knows exactly what that means. Wesley van Swol was born in Delft in 1977 and grew up in the village of Wateringen. While visiting hardcore parties at legendary venues like the Energiehal and Sporthallen Zuid as a young spirit in the early 1990s, he encountered a magical thing that caught his attention and enthusiasm: the craft of working the turntables, like the heroes he saw rocking at these raves. 

In 1993, a friend taught him the initial tricks of the trade, after which a period of intensive practicing followed for Wesley. When that same friend checked in with him half a year later, he was knocked off his feet by the skills that his buddy had developed in such a short amount of time. This had to be his calling, and so he continued. His new addiction didn’t go unnoticed by his family. One day his mother asked him to come upstairs, where she had installed a new pair of Pioneer Technics SL-MK turntables, a mixer and the rest of the package a DJ needs to kick start what would eventually become the success it is now.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Freestyle DJ and producer Playboyz (John Wijdoogen) has been fascinated by dance music from a really young age. He was only 12 when he started to learn how to DJ. Where other kids went to the local pub, he visited all kinds of dance events. When he was 16 he had the chance to work at the local record store. This place played a major role in his development as an artist. It gave him the inspiration and platform to create his own unique style.

            <description><![CDATA[Joey van Ingen a.k.a. Radical Redemption is the man behind this new name in the hardstyle scene. He’s born in 1990, and grew up in the east of the Netherlands. From day one he was interested in all kinds of music. At age 10 he started to play the drums. His interest went to the rhythmic elements in music. As drummer he played in several bands, ‘Pacific’ became his main project. But, at that same time he came in touch with the harder side of dance music. He had to make a choice.

Joey wanted to spin records, so he bought two turntables and started practicing. After a while he organized hardstyle parties in his garage for his friends. They had a good night partying and Joey had a good night behind the decks! A couple of months later he became the resident DJ in a local club. But, what if he could spin his own tracks? That would be totally awesome! So, around the beginning of 2009 he started producing hardstyle. He used all his spare time to improve his producing skills. Day in, day out, producing, producing and producing. (and after that, producing!)

While improving his skills, Joey developed his own style. A lot of rhythmic elements, raw sounds, heavy kicks and dark atmospheres will define this. Also thinking outside the box, trying something new and experimenting with a lot of sounds. At the end of 2010 his passion and hard work fascinated Crypsis. This resulted in a collaboration named ‘Darkness is Calling’, played at Hard Bass 2011, in front of 25.000 insane party people! This is just the beginning, so watch out, more tracks will be coming..]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Hardstyle and hardcore pioneer The Prophet has travelled the world for 25 years, performing at parties such as Tomorrowland, Qlimax, EDC Las Vegas, Thunder-dome, TomorrowWorld and Defqon.1. He is the founder of leading hardstyle label Scantraxx, which gave rise to the success of many artists, including Headhunterz and Wildstylez. His music is being played and loved by the biggest names both in and outside the hardstyle scene. Unlike his alias suggests, The Prophet doesn’t pass on musical messages; he creates them!

His musical career began in 1982, before the house movement. Throughout the following years he invented, produced, played and remixed hip-hop, hardcore, hardstyle, club, progressive and more. It was important that the music always matched one crucial code word: tough! As long as it sounds tough, his musical heart continues to beat in various rhythms.

Being a key player in the dance scene can call for some time to reflect, which has indeed shown up in recent years. The Prophet has searched for the combination of being, but also staying a pioneer in a constantly changing and rapidly growing hardstyle scene. His latest releases show a new direction. Full speed ahead, with a nod to the past. The Prophet is far from done, so the question remains: are you out there still with him? H3Y!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[They are without any doubt among the most popular acts in the hardest life form of hardcore. As some might now, the origin of The Sickest Squad was the Sick DJ Team. Three guys teamed up in 2000: Jacopo Stevanato, Samuele Gozzo and Sirio Carino. After dropping their first EP “Sick 001”, they got in touch with The Stunned Guys, who released their “Inspector Fucker” four tracker in 2003 on the G-Net imprint and appeared on the Traxtorm Power 2003 compilation. After this release, they took the time to develop their sound towards the upcoming frenchcore sound. After tweaking, improving and very hard work, they sent a demo of their work to mr. Frenchcore: DJ Radium.

Radium recognized the talent of the trio and contacted them with Randy, who of course owned the Randy 909% label. Randy dropped the “Smart Power” EP together with them in 2005. After that, The Sick DJ Team used a new alias for their music: the “Obbligo o verita” EP was the start of The Sickest Squad, which was the start of a big career in Frenchcore. Their tracks got picked up by the audience, the vinylsales were good and the tracks also made it on various compilations. Their “The Sickest” EP was also an important one for The Sickest Squad: it was the first time that they dropped a track in their notorious “In”-series.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Twenty years behind the decks, Tommaso Marra alias Tommyknocker is one of the scene's biggest players. With countless hit records and featured on hundreds of compilations, he's responsible for spreading Italian hardcore all over the world. Tommy buys his first turntables in 1992, and two years later he discovers hardcore. Captivated by the fat kicks and raw sounds, the young DJ without a name starts spinning at illegal raves in Rome, parties with a unique atmosphere and sound that very much influenced Tommy as an artist.

The name Tommyknocker appears for the first time on a flyer in 1995, when Tommy starts spinning for Freddy K (A Roman techno pioneer) in a club and on the radio. He was one of the first DJ's to plays hardcore in a club, and with great success: He becomes a resident at the Oxygen parties, where he comes in contact with many international artists. In the following years, Tommy continues playing hardcore in his city, when in 1998 he decides to step up his game and start producing. Inspired by artists such as Promo, Stunned Guys, PCP, Miro and Lory D, he locks himself up in the studio and works night and day.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Edward Aandewiel was no stranger to the hard dance scene when launching his “E-Force” solo project back in 2011. With experience in various harder styles, Edward knew exactly what it was going to take to climb his way to the top.

His extensive history got him in contact with A2 Records, where he had his first release under the E-Force name. No less than 4 tracks were directly featured on the infamous ‘A2 Records - Unleashed’ album, including ‘Remote Control’. In the years that followed, multiple hits set the standard for contemporary Raw Hardstyle, with 2012 - 2013 showing to be a particularly boundary breaking period as he unleashed ‘Freakz at Night’ among others. 

The triumphs didn’t stop there, as in 2014, his solo track ‘Seven’ was undoubtedly the #1 Raw Hardstyle hit of the year, and resided at the top of Hardstyle.com’s chart for over a month]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[De La Soul is an American hip hop trio formed in 1987 on Long Island, New York. The band is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. The members are Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo. The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song "Plug Tunin'". 

With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising, has been called "a hip hop masterpiece." It is the band's biggest commercial success to date, with their subsequent albums selling progressively less, despite receiving high praise from critics. They were influential in the early stages of rapper/actor Mos Def's career, and are a core part of the Spitkicker collective.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper from Compton, California. Lamar embarked on his musical career as a teenager under the moniker K-Dot, releasing a mixtape that garnered local attention and led to his signing with Carson-based independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Lamar began to gain major recognition in 2010 after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated. The following year, he released the independent album Section.80, which included Lamar's debut single, "HiiiPoWeR". By that time, he had collaborated with several prominent artists in the hip hop industry, including The Game, Snoop Dogg, and Busta Rhymes.

Lamar secured a recording contract with Aftermath and Interscope Records in 2012. His major-label debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was released in October 2012 to critical sucess. The record contained the top 40 singles "Swimming Pools (Drank)", "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe", and "Poetic Justice", and debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart; it was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Preceded by the Grammy Award-winning single "i", Lamar released his third studio album To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015 to universal acclaim. The album drew on free jazz, funk, soul, and spoken word, and debuted atop the charts in the U.S. and the UK. In 2016, Lamar released untitled unmastered., a collection of unreleased demos that originated during the recording sessions for Butterfly.

Lamar has received wide acclaim and a number of accolades over the course of his career, including seven Grammy Awards. In early 2013, MTV named Lamar the No. 1 "Hottest MC in the Game" on their annual list. Aside from his solo career, Lamar is also known as a member of the West Coast hip hop supergroup Black Hippy, alongside his TDE labelmates and fellow South Los Angeles-based rappers Ab-Soul, Jay Rock and Schoolboy Q]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Partysquad is a Dutch DJ production team. It consists of DJ Jerry (Jerry Leembruggen) and MC Ruben (Ruben Fernhout). Futtize (Andrés Echeverri) also holds a semi-permanent position since 2011. Since the early 2000s they have had 12 singles charting on the Dutch Top 40. They produced part of M.I.A.'s fourth album, Matangi in 2013. The Partysquad started producing in the hip hop genre, collaborating with many Dutch rappers. In 2006, they released a hip hop album titled De Bazen Van De Club. The album spawned 6 singles between 2006 and 2007, all of which charted on the Dutch Single Top 100 chart. The song "Rampeneren" with Ali B and Yes-R also peaked at No. 4 on the Dutch Top 40. "Wat Wil Je Doen" was featured on the soundtrack of the 2005 Dutch comedy film Het Schnitzelparadijs.

Since 2007, the group switched to producing in a wide range of music genres including electro house, reggae, dub and trap. They have performed as opening acts for 50 Cent, Kanye West and The Pussycat Dolls, among others. In 2008, the group went on hiatus, after DJ Jerry had a car accident which left him in coma. As he recovered, The Partysquad made a comeback in 2010, collaborating with Afrojack for the single "A Msterdamn". In 2009, they signed to Diplo's record label Mad Decent and released their first international EP Hollertronix #10 under the label. Their breakthrough on the US dance scene came with the reggae-influenced collaboration track with Major Lazer titled "Original Don". After the success of the song, The Partysquad created a 6-song EP Badman Rave EP, which expanded on the style of "Original Don". The group described their sound as "experimental rave EDM". 

The Partysquad created their own label Rebel Yard, as sub-label of Spinnin' Records. Among the artists signed to the label are DJs and producers Armand van Helden, A-Trak, Boaz, FS Green, Major Lazer and Yellow Claw, and rappers M.I.A., Sjaak and The Opposites. In 2014, The Partysquad remixed "Dibby Dibby Sound" by DJ Fresh vs. Jay Fay featuring Ms. Dynamite.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Glenn de Randamie (6 August 1984), better known by his stage name Typhoon, is a Dutch MC (rapper). He is currently signed to Dutch hip-hop record label Top Notch. He is well known for his philosophical lyrics, which are considered to be the main strength of his music. Typhoon was born and raised in the Dutch town of Zwolle. He came from an artistic family. His brothers (O-Dog and Blaxtar) are also MCs and his sister is a singer. 

Inspired by Blaxtar, Typhoon started writing at the age of 12 and as a rap artist with the group Rudeteenz, which he joined in when he was 15. It consisted of him, his brother Blaxtar and the well-known Dutch hip-hop formation Opgezwolle. He made some guest appearances for Opgezwolle before winning Grote Prijs, the biggest hip-hop prize in the Netherlands. In the same year he got his VWO diploma at Carolus Clusius College in Zwolle.

After winning Grote Prijs, Typhoon signed to the record label Top Notch. He started making separate thematic songs for a Dutch music channel called "The Box" with the producer Nav. The themes varied from religion and sexism to money and sex. In 2006 he started working on his solo debut Tussen Licht en Lucht which was released the next year. In 2009 he formed the group Fakkelbrigade with Dutch rappers Rico and Sticks (from Opgezwolle) and ART.

Later that year he received the Zilveren Harp, a Dutch prize for upcoming artists. Typhoon also went to Kenya for development aid with the organization Edukans. In 2010 he brought out an eight track EP called Chocolade with the New Cool Collective.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Being out in front of people and just being ‘The Man’” might sound like a vague and ridiculous dream to have, but for Cameron Thomaz it might be the most appropriate thought to cross any mind. Better known as Wiz Khalifa, the son of two military parents has always had his eye on being a new standard by which cool is measured. Rapping since the third grade and starting to record music at 14 was probably a step in the right direction. The next best move? Inking a deal to Rostrum Records after a meeting with Benjy Grinberg.

Fresh out of high school, it was time to either sink or swim. In 2005 Wiz released his first mixtape, “Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania.” The mixtape was quickly accepted by the local scene and began to gain buzz outside of Pittsburgh. With that excitement growing by the day, it was the perfect time for a proper commercial album. Wiz soon dropped “Show and Prove,” which Okayplayer.com claimed was “arguably the best album of the year.” The accolades began piling up and Khalifa was receiving significant co-signs from XXL, Rolling Stone, and VIBE, alike. A deal with Warner Bros. Records soon followed.

Any other 20-year-old probably would’ve let all this hype go to their heads, but not Wiz. As focused as ever, Wiz only saw this praise as an opportunity to work harder. In 2007, with the help of famed mixtape DJ, Green Lantern, Wiz released “Grow Season,” which was soon followed by “Prince of The City 2.” The sequel to “Prince of The City” would soon out grow its predecessor so much so that the demand for Khalifa’s music was greater than ever.

Unfortunately, the relationship between Khalifa and Warner Bros. dissolved, and once again, Wiz found himself as an independent artist. Typically a huge roadblock for any artist, Wiz refused to allow the lack of a major label deal to slow down his momentum. He and his Rostrum team hit the ground running in 2009 and released three highly acclaimed mixtapes: “Flight School,” “How Fly,” a collaborative mixtape with New Orleans rapper Curren$y, and “Burn After Rolling.” The album “Deal Or No Deal” followed in the Fall and debuted at the top of the iTunes “Hip-Hop” chart, and has remained in the top 50 to date.

In the months following, both his fanbase (known as the “Taylor Gang”) and the anticipation for his new mixtape grew daily. Once Wiz dropped “Kush & Orange Juice” in early 2010, it was clear that he had established himself as one of the rap-game’s brightest young stars to watch. With an unprecedented amount of downloads, not to mention both the top search on Google as well as the number one trending topic on Twitter, it seemed as if the entire nation was on board with the “Taylor Gang” movement. Many said that the release of “Kush & Orange Juice” placed Wiz as the valedictorian of his “XXL Freshmen 10” class and kicked open the doors he and his team were looking to walk through.

Fast forward a few months, and together Wiz and Rostrum Records proudly announced that these doors were those of Atlantic Records, the new home to Wiz Khalifa. Following this huge milestone in his career, Wiz soon embarked on a stint on the famed “Rock The Bells” tour alongside such legends as Lauryn Hill and Snoop Dogg, immediately followed by his nation-wide headlining tour, appropriately dubbed the “Waken Baken Tour.” After receiving co-signs from a multitude of rap veterans, including Rick Ross and Diddy, and humbly rejecting Drake’s offer to join his recent tour, it became evident that Wiz also established himself as a prominent staple online with over 3,000,000 friends on Facebook, and over 1,000,000 fans following him on Twitter. With the video for his first Atlantic Records release, “Black & Yellow,” getting an astonishing 30 million views on YouTube, there is no question about it: Wiz Khalifa’s debut album is bound to be something great.]]></description>

Following J Dilla's death in 2006 and Baatin's death in 2009, T3 remains the sole surviving member of the original lineup. Over its history the group has been through several line-up changes, which once included J Dilla's younger brother Illa J, but now the group currently exists as a duo of T3 and producer Young RJ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The original line-up of Fred Durst, Wes Borland, Sam Rivers, John Otto, and DJ Lethal are back from an eight year hiatus to bring their world back to ours. Fred Durst and Wes Borland said in a joint statement:

"We decided we were more disgusted and bored with the state of heavy popular music than we were with each other. Regardless of where our separate paths have taken us, we recognize there is a powerful and unique energy with this particular group of people we have not found anywhere else. This is why Limp Bizkit is back."

The guys will kick off a world tour in the Spring on the overseas festival circuit with headline shows sprinkled in throughout Eastern Europe and Europe, selected dates include, in late May, Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic countries where Limp Bizkit has never played before despite huge demand, along with major festivals like Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park in Germany, more dates to be announced shortly. 

A new album, which would be the original group’s first full-length effort since 2000, is also planned. Limp Bizkit’s first three albums have sold over 20 million copies in the U.S. alone, and another 13 million in the rest of the world.]]></description>

Balfori quit shortly after due to musical divergence. In early '99 the band found Archaon whose speed and technique took their music to a new level of intensity and brutality.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Abbath is a relatively new arrival on the black metal scene but any black metal fan will tell you that Abbath is the frontman of recently disbanded Norwegian black metal legends Immortal. Although disbanded may not be the right word: apparently Abbath’s former brothers in arms Demonaz and Horgh will carry on the Immortal name but there are still some pending legal issues. 

Whatever the outcome, Abbath will not be a part of the new line-up. Instead he recruited bassist King (ex-God Seed, ex-Gorgoroth) and masked drummer Creature to form Abbath. They played their first show last year and are currently working on a debut album of razor-sharp, spine-chilling black metal tracks played at breakneck speed. Just the way we like it.

            <description><![CDATA[In the history of Heavy Metal not many bands can claim to be able to celebrate their breakthrough twice.  After a 15 year hiatus ACCEPT managed this with »Blood Of The Nations« in 2010, returning with a vengeance by charting all over the world and topping critics’s and fan polls in the process. In their home country ACCEPT charted at an incredible #4 in the sales charts making this the highest position in the band’s career at that time. They surprised fans and silenced doubters! ACCEPT are back – and started running! The first world tour left no questions unanswered: they are here to stay! Finishing with RECORD OF THE YEAR in various countries.

The successor »Stalingrad« in 2012 maintained the high level, followed by numerous nominations as “record of the year”, and a stunning tempo they continued to tour the globe and perform in front of huge crowds with  impressive  chart entries (#5 in Hungary, #6 in Germany, #8 in Finland, #16 in the UK Rock Charts, #17 in Switzerland and #22 in Norway, to name but a few) in their pockets.

In 2014 they released  »Blind Rage«, the latest installment in this amazing return, they wrote  history once more! The band’s creative streak has delivered a thunderstorm of riffs, only one Wolf Hoffmann is able to set aflame. Besides the “red ACCEPT-line”, as the band likes to call it, the only goal was to “remain interesting”. Another factor that has turned into an ACCEPT trademark, is the voice of singer Mark Tornillo. The New Jersey born musician has been the man behind the microphone since the ACCEPT return  took off in 2010. Within the course of the three albums, he has grown into his role as frontman of these “teutonic terrors”. Wolf Hoffmann, who likes to call himself a “naturally born perfectionist” and hard to please,  praises Mark Tornillo  and states that “his accomplishment is outstanding” and the fans love him!

While ACCEPT like to get newly inspired as far as the creative aspect is concerned, they did put the fine tuning of »Blind Rage« into the most capable hands of producer Andy Sneap (MEGADETH, EXODUS, FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH). After the two previous records  »Blood Of The Nations« and »Stalingrad« the decision to work with Sneap again, was far more than a “never change a winning team” situation. “There is so much more behind this”, states Hoffmann. “It’s getting easier by the time, because the blueprints are getting clearer and you get to the point so much faster – meaning, the dynamics are already shown during the first recordings.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[AC/DC are an Australian rock band, formed in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. A hard rock/blues rock band, they were also pioneers of heavy metal, although they have always dubbed their music simply "rock and roll".

AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist.  Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.

The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second-highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[A determined band, dedicated to the right cause, knowing hard work pays off? Or just a bunch of stubborn ragers? In After All’s case it’s hard to tell the difference. Plain and simple, these Belgian thrash metal veterans are both.

On their ninth album ‘Waves Of Annihilation’, After All lift the fine art of thrash metal song writing to a new level. “Of course you need killer riffs for thrash metal”, said guitarist Dries Van Damme, “but for After All, the riff is only the starting point. In the end we write songs, with hooks and big choruses that stick. That requires considerably more effort than just putting together some riffs.”

One rule: no limits
Proving their point on the new record, After All take the metal fan on a dazzling rollercoaster ride, from the ferocious thrash outbursts of ‘Rejection Overruled’ and ‘The Unusual Sin’, to the pounding metal of ‘Fall In Line’ and the jaw-dropping epic tale that is ‘After The Hurt Is Gone’. “We wrote most of the songs together, as a band”, said guitarist Christophe Depree, “with only one rule: we did whatever we wanted, without any limits.”

The introduction of singer Sammy Peleman on the previous album ‘Dawn Of The Enforcer’ got the band a lot of attention. The press compared Peleman’s vocal delivery to metal royalty such as Rob Halford, Geoff Tate and John Cyriis. “The high-pitched vocals are still there”, Peleman explained, “but we deliberately broadened the spectrum. There’s a lot of heavy metal vocals on the new record, as well as thrash metal shouting and some seriously heavy growling.” In other words: the vocals are as versatile as the songs themselves.

Mutants
‘Dawn Of The Enforcer’ proved to be After All’s best selling album so far, gaining critical acclaim of both the press and the metal community, including an entry in Rock Hard’s ‘10 x Dynamit’. It motivated the band to strengthen its relationship with producer Dan Swanö and graphic artist Ed Repka.

“Dan Swanö meticulously crafted a heavy, yet open sound”, said bass player Frederik Vanmassenhove, “far removed from today’s loudness war. It’s all we hoped for - and then some.” The same sense of detail can be found in Ed Repka’s artwork, portraying how an elite of survivors leaves a post-nuclear world at the mercy of rabid mutants. Seriously: it just doesn’t get any more metal than that…

Road warriors
Over the years, After All have been tireless road warriors: opening a stadium show for Judas Priest one day, playing a sweaty club the other. After All were part of Killfest 2011, a four-week trek across Europe with Overkill, Destruction and Heathen. In support of ‘Dawn Of The Enforcer’, After All toured Germany with Sacred Reich and continued playing shows with bands as diverse as Queensryche, Manilla Road, Angel Witch, Vicious Rumors or Obituary.

In previous years, After All toured Europe with well-known acts such as King Diamond, Anthrax, Fear Factory, Agent Steel, Stone Sour, Testament, Exodus, Sepultura, and many more - and played high-profile festivals such as Graspop Metal Meeting (with Iron Maiden), Keep It True, Metal Dayz, Alcatraz Metal Fest, Dokkem Open Air and more. To support ‘Waves Of Annihilation’, the band will hit the road once more in 2016…]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Amon Amarth is a Swedish melodic death metal band from Tumba, founded in 1992. The band takes its name from the Sindarin name of Mount Doom, a volcano in J. R. R. Tolkien′s Middle-earth. Their lyrics mostly deal with Vikings, their mythology and their history, leading to the band often being labeled as Viking metal. The band is composed of vocalist Johan Hegg, guitarists Olavi Mikkonen and Johan Söderberg and bassist Ted Lundström. Amon Amarth has released ten studio albums, one compilation album, one EP, one video album, and ten music videos. 

Their first studio album, Once Sent from the Golden Hall, debuted in 1998. Four more studio releases followed, before the band saw their breakthrough with the 2008 album Twilight of the Thunder God, which debuted at No. 11 on the Swedish album charts and No. 50 on the US Billboard 200. Two more albums, Surtur Rising and Deceiver of the Gods followed in 2011 and 2013, respectively.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Anthrax is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed in 1981 by guitarist Scott Ian and bassist Dan Lilker. The group was considered one of the leaders of the thrash metal scene during the 1980s. Of the "Big Four" thrash metal bands (the others being Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer), Anthrax were the only band from the East Coast. As of 2016, the band has released eleven studio albums, a number of singles and an EP with American hip hop group Public Enemy. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Anthrax sold 2.5 million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, with worldwide sales of 10 million.

Noted for its live performances, Anthrax signed with the independent label Megaforce Records (which released the band's debut studio album in 1984). Lilker soon left the band to form Nuclear Assault, and was replaced by roadie Frank Bello. Vocalist Neil Turbin was replaced after two years by Matt Fallon who was then subsequently replaced in 1985 by Joey Belladonna. With a new lineup, the band recorded Spreading the Disease (distributed by Island Records) in 1985. 

Anthrax's third album, Among the Living, was released in 1987 to critical praise. The band experienced another lineup change in 1992, when John Bush replaced Belladonna as lead vocalist. Sound of White Noise was released the following year, peaking at number seven on the Billboard 200. Studio recordings during the 1990s saw the band, influenced by other genres, experimenting with its sound.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Founded by the Amott brothers after Michael Amott left Carcass. Originally with Johan Liiva as singer, the band's debut entitled Black Earth was released by the now defunct Swedish label Wrong Again Records in 1996. It obtained a fair amount of success in Japan, achieving MTV rotation with their first single "Bury Me an Angel", as well as moderate success in Sweden.

It is a common misconception that Johan Liiva played bass on Black Earth - it was in fact played by Michael Amott, who gave the credit to Liiva to make the album seem more like a band effort than a side project (which is what Arch Enemy essentially was at the time). The band signed a contract with Century Media Records for the release of Stigmata in 1998. This was the first Arch Enemy album to be released worldwide and it caught the attention of a wider audience, gaining popularity in both Europe and America. 

In November 2000, Johan Liiva was sacked as the vocalist with the cited reasons being "a failure to perform adequately live". Angela Gossow, originally from Germany, replaced Liiva as vocalist. The first album featuring Gossow was Wages of Sin, released in 2001. This is also the first album where the band used C tuning, which they have kept until the present. That same year, Arch Enemy took part in the "Japan's Beast Feast 2002" concert, playing alongside Slayer and Motörhead.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Architects are a British metalcore band from Brighton, England. The band currently consists of vocalist Sam Carter, guitarist and keyboardist Tom Searle and his twin brother, drummer Dan Searle, as well as bassist Alex Dean and guitarist Adam Christianson. The band's first name was Inharmonic, which was swiftly changed to Counting the Days, and finally to Architects after a couple of years. They have released six studio albums and one split EP with Dead Swans to date.

They released their debut album Nightmares in 2006 through In at the Deep End records. After the departure of their original vocalist, Matt Johnson, Sam Carter joined the band and made his first appearance on Architects' second album Ruin released in 2007 through United by Fate records. In 2009 the band released Hollow Crown through Century Media records. They then released their fourth album The Here And Now in 2011, which showed the band's take a step in a more melodic "clean-cut post-hardcore" direction. 

Upon its release the album was well received by critics, but was panned by their fanbase. The next year Architects returned to their original style with their fifth album Daybreaker, which featured more politicised lyrics as opposed to the violent and comedic lyrics prominent throughout their older work. Their sixth album Lost Forever // Lost Together was released in 2014 through Epitaph Records. Their seventh album All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us is due for release on 27 May 2016, also through Epitaph.

All members of the band are vegan, having turned to veganism after watching several documentaries on the subject. The band is also a promoter of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, with Carter being one of its British ambassadors]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[There aren’t many artists around whose career has already lasted a quarter of a century. But then, there are even fewer who have experienced no setbacks whatsoever in 25 years. And there are only a few guitarists in the world of rock music who have created their own brand just with their name, causing over 1.5 million people to buy their music.
Axel Rudi Pell is one of those rare exceptions. And so it doesn’t come as a surprise that his latest offering “Into The Storm” is also one of his best; after all, anniversaries are always special. Although this is the fifteenth studio album (featuring his own material) in Pell’s career to date, he didn’t approach it any different than its predecessors. “There hasn’t been one day in my life when I haven’t been pushed by Ronnie James Dio’s spirit to write something mystical,” the 53-year-old explains his motivation. Even though ARP has nothing against efficiency and discipline, creativity doesn’t come at the flick of a switch. “I couldn’t sit down with it and compose from nine to five, that doesn’t work for me.”

As inspiration doesn’t comply with office hours, Pell praises the technological achievements of recent years. “My cell phone is almost like a mobile recording studio, it’s always busy. And this time things worked particularly well.” Despite the fact that the omens weren’t so good: in July of 2013 he unfortunately had to part ways with drummer Mike Terrana because their schedules didn’t match. After 15 years together, this wasn’t an easy step for either of them, but there was no slander or dirty linen washed in public – in contrast to most line-up changes, there wasn’t any of the usual background noise that seems to have become the rule in this industry. A fact Pell has every right to be proud of: “We’re all professionals and we behave like professionals.” So what to do? As Bobby Rondinelli (Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Blue Öyster Cult etc.) has always been one of his favorite drummers, he was on the top of Pell’s list. And now Rondinelli has joined the band, as simple as that. No miracle, but the result of Axel’s excellent reputation within the hard rock and metal community. “Bobby had heard a lot about me and immediately joined.” And this is the point where Pell has come full circle, because the Brooklyn-born drummer is not only the first of his musicians to have played in one of his favorite groups (guess who that might be?), but Rondinelli has also brought fresh blood into the band: “Bobby fell in love with the new songs head over heels, I didn’t have to tell him what to do, he did everything right the first time.” The other American in the band, singer Johnny Gioeli, is also raving about the new material: “I think ‘Into The Storm’ is one the best ARP albums ever.” Why? Well, the compositions are catchier, more elaborate. Melodic rockers like “Long Way To Go” and “High Above” alternate with up-tempo songs like “Tower Of Lies” and “Burning Chains”. Of one Axel’s most beautiful ballads to date, “When Truth Hurts”, is almost as heartrending as the touching Neil Young cover “Hey Hey My My”. Epic masterpieces such as “Touching Heaven” and the ten-minute-plus title track still have that 70s touch we all love. There are also two extra tracks for the Digipak: the glorious instrumental “White Cats (Opus #6 Scivolare)” is likely to see “guitar hero” fanatics go nuts and the Blackmore’s Night cover “Way To Mandalay” could easily have been borrowed from a Rainbow album now.]]></description>

Their second album Metal Resistance was released on April 1, 2016. Besides dancing, the trio all perform vocals. Su-metal is the main vocalist, credited on Babymetal's official site with vocals and dancing, while Moametal and Yuimetal are credited with scream and dance. Babymetal's costumes take a variety of cues from the popular Japanese Gothic and Punk Lolita styles, with an emphasis on red and black]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[When Black Sabbath announced their retirement in early 2015, the farewell tour initially included dates in North America, Australia and New Zealand. With their appearance at GMM2016 now confirmed, the band’s European fans can rest easy: frontman Ozzy Osbourne, Tommy Iommi and Geezer Butler are headlining Graspop Metal Meeting on Friday 17 June 2016. 

Since the release of their self-titled 1970 debut, Sabbath have been at the forefront of the heavy metal genre with seminal tracks such as Paranoid, War Pigs and Iron Man to name but a few. The final tour by the greatest metal band of all time promises to be the Birmingham natives’ most enthralling production yet. Black Sabbath’s last Belgian show: true metal fans will need no further incentive! (Text: Wim Vander Haegen / Translation: Nick Devos)]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Grooving and shredding death metal from The Netherlands! From the foundations of several Dutch metal acts like Altar, Houwitser, Supreme Pain and Sinister, Bleeding Gods was born in late 2012. After he had left Houwitser in 2012, Ramon started to write a basic album on guitar. Just basic demo songs that were groovy, fast and also slow, but most of al: heavy! 

When the pre-production demo was done, the time was right to look for people to join in and some fellow metal-musicians, contacts from the past years on several festivals, club shows and tours were asked. The former bands of all the guys were (technical) death metal bands, so the challenge to do something different this time was attractive. Bleeding Gods plays groovy, riffing and shredding metal with some 
thrash and death influences in it.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Welsh metal-core band Bullet For My Valentine has spent most of the past two years taking over the world with massive U.K., European, U.S. and worldwide tours, sharing the stage with Guns N Roses, Metallica and Iron Maiden, playing the Main Stage at just about every rock festival on the planet, and seeing their 2006 debut album THE POISON - an album London's daily The Sun called "One of the finest debut albums in rock history" - sell more than one-million copies worldwide – 350,000 in the U.S. alone – a very rare achievement for an emerging band.

Back home, Bullet For My Valentine has graced the covers of the UK’s Kerrang!, Rock Sound, and Metal Hammer. They won Metal Hammer’s 2006 “Golden God Award” for Best British Band, and the 2006 Kerrang! Award for “Best UK Single” for their track “Tears Don’t Fall.” Here in America, Revolver magazine heralded the band “British Import of the Year,” and THE POISON generated the hit singles “Tears Don’t Fall” and “All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me),” with the video for “All These Things I Hate” going to the #1 spot on MTV2. The band has toured North America three times, and in early 2007, they sold out their first headline trek.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Both originally hailing from the Ruhr Area, the largest agglomeration in Germany, modern metal force CALIBAN and Century Media Records are finally worldwide partners in crime after being neighbours for years and already co-operating for CALIBAN's last album "The Awakening" for North America. After Heaven Shall Burn and Maroon Century Media Records is delighted to welcome CALIBAN and hence being a home for the trinity of German modern metal.

CALIBAN's new album "Say Hello To Tragedy" marks a fantastic start for this new global partnership and impressively unites an aggressive, ferocious metal punch with emotive melodies and choruses. Through the course of the record you can discover thrashing viciousness, blasting speed and crushing breaks as well as harmonic clean vocals resulting in an opus rich in contrast and diversity. Songs like the murderous opener "24 Years", "Caliban's Revenge" or "No One Is Safe" prove that CALIBAN have developed into an unrivalled modern metal beast captivating the listener with raging heaviness and catchy melodies to equal terms. 

The album's concept deals with the question which tragedies happen nowadays or could have been prevented, if people would just open their eyes and at least care a bit about their neighbours, relatives and the world in general. Some songs are entirely fictional whereas other ones refer to real life dramas like the Fritzl case.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Carcass is considered to be the major inspiration and musical foundation for most deathgrind/goregrind bands, as well as being one of the founding fathers of melodic death metal when they had switched their genre to the melodic death metal sound by the early '90s.

The band was first known as Disattack, playing hardcore punk back in 1985. After releasing their first demo in 1986, their bass player left the band and Jeff Walker joined them after leaving Electro Hippies. By that time, they were also changing their name to Carcass, whose logo was drawn by Jeff Walker. Soon their drummer was replaced by Ken Owen and the singer by Sanjiv. Bill Steer also left Napalm Death in order to concentrate on Carcass.

Carcass started as a goregrind band which they carried out on their demo tapes, and first two albums, then moved to a death metal sound which evolved into their melodic death and heavy metal roots before their split. Their Heartwork album, released in 1993, is one of the first melodic death metal albums ever released.

Bill Steer moved into the stoner rock band Firebird (not to be confused with the 1978 NWOBHM band Firebird, Mike focused on his retro band Spiritual Beggars before forming a side-project with his brother Chris called Arch Enemy which went on to become very successful. Jeff, Ken and Carlo formed the short-lived Blackstar after the demise of Carcass.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Over the last twenty years, Finland’s CHILDREN OF BODOM have incorporated many different musical styles into their celebrated sound, leading critics and fans to label them as melodic death metal, thrash metal, symphonic black metal, and neoclassical metal. Their enthralling mix of melodic hooks and instrumental acrobatics have solidified the band as one of the leading voices of music’s new generation.

Formed as Inearthed in 1993, the group is led by superstar frontman / guitarist Alexi Laiho, who was voted “Best Metal Guitarist” by readers of Guitar World magazine. COB albums are no strangers to debut positions on the American Billboard Top 200 chart and with three consecutive albums debuting at number one on Finnish album charts, they are one of their home country’s bestselling artists of all time with more than 250,000 records sold there alone.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[It’s loud, heavy and primitive – and with their 11th album, D-A-D have produced what is probably their purest, tightest rock and roll record ever. The album is fuelled by pared-down live shows, wonderfully uncomplicated riffs, and a reunion with one of their favorite producers. 

Everyone talks about how tough the second one is. But what about record No. 11? The album you have to make after you’ve released a box set celebrating your first quarter century? The record that comes after you’ve started your fourth decade as the flagship of Danish rock – with your last many albums shooting straight to Number One? For D-A-D, the solution was easy: They did what they always do, and that means never repeating what they’d done before. 

The four veteran rockers are determined to keep moving forward. “If we don’t, it’ll kill us mentally,” says guitarist Cobber. This time, the step forward has taken them right into the bare bones of rock and roll. One reason for this has to do with the way 
the record was made – in short breaks from an arduous tour. Nothing was prepared, which meant little was left but the raw dynamics between the different band members. And since they’d been playing small clubs in Europe without a light show or other trappings, they wanted to come across sounding pure and undiluted on the album too. 

“We wanted to make an album based on a feeling. So you can hear we’re coming from the exact same place on song after song. We’ve always been able to do this with our lyrics, But musically, we’ve actually taken pride in allowing more elaborate production,” says Jesper Binzer.”This time we just decided to skip the bells and whistles,” Cobber adds. The band quickly discovered that that their original basic tracks contained a wealth of melody and liberating simplicity. Just completely unclad. “We peeled off all the layers. We decided to trust in the basic rock and roll riff. We cut right to the bone and left it that way,” Cobber says. 

The band was feeling very confident and they knew who they wanted to put the whole thing together: Nick Foss. Foss had produced several D-A-D classics and Binzer says “the man’s ears are hardwired straight to his heart.” “He instantly liked 
what he heard of the bands new rough tracks. “Nick came in and figured out what was holding our material together. He isn’t afraid of coming right out and saying ‘Here we really have something’. And in terms of production, the big difference 
between this album and our last few is that we sound like rock and roll quartet. Nothing more, nothing less. It’s pure, tight and hard-hitting”, says drummer Laust Sonne. The band decided to take the same approach to naming the album. They’ve 
called just “D-A-D”, plain and simple. As Cobber puts it, “it goes right to the core”. And when the band plays their new material for close followers, they say they can hear the energy of “No Fuel Left for the Pilgrims”, the melodies on “Everything Glows” and the power of “Helpyourselfish”. It’s both completely new and perfectly D-A-D. 

You can hear it on the main tracks. The single, “I Want What She’s Got” is already grabbing attention with its bastard blues sound. This was one of the first songs the band put together for the album, and the track that made such a big impression on Nick Foss. Another strong track is “Last Time in Neverland”, which helped convince the band that they were writing top-class melodies. After they’d recorded this one, they walked through the city singing it like four boys who’d just discovered the magic of rock and roll. Then there are songs that stand out for the simplest reasons: “Place of the Heart” because of the mix of muscular guitar and unashamed pop, and “The End” because it breaks this band’s record for playing an insanely simple riff as long and loud as they can. 

Yet underneath it all lurks a serious question. “What’s it like having all those years and all that ass-kicking behind us and to stand up there like bad boys in our 40s? The lyrics are half sermonising, half self-help book on how to have morals in an immoral way. It’s so navel-gazing it starts to look like some kind of universal truth”, says Binzer. 

D-A-D leave no doubt that the tough album No. 11 was actually easy to make. Just because the band have fun keeping on, and the desire to keep forging ahead get the creative sparks flying the minute they all get in the same room. Exactly because they’ve been at the top for so many years. “We get so much in return every time we make an album or play a concert. And that energy can take us a long way,” says Sonne, before Binzer concludes with a final broad stroke: “We feel blessed to be able to keep living our dream.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The band started out in 1993 by Blackmoon and Lord Ahriman. A year later after they had released the debut EP "Dark Funeral" (which was re-released again with different cover art, title and bonus songs) they signed on with No Fashion Records. They continued to release albums on No Fashion until 2001, later got signed by Regain Records.

Not to be confused with a Danish band called "Dark Funeral", which released a demo called "In Thy Forest" 1993 with keyboard-ambient sound only. The Swedish band Dark Funeral here never recorded a demo.

            <description><![CDATA[With an ever-increasing fan base, picking up new listeners around the world thanks to their drive to tour familiar and less-travelled places, it’s no wonder Deep Purple operates on fresh cycles of adrenalin. No resting on yesteryear. Deep Purple has released 4 studio albums since 1996, but that total is augmented by an abundance of solo work and special projects from all 5 band members.

Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Steve Morse and Don Airey, Mark VIII of the band, continue to travel the scope of hard rock — the textures and nuances of recent works are anything but thudding retreads. If you set a random play setting for the band’s entire catalogue, the result is one of the finest musical outputs to grace rock music.

The latter-year Purple has moved progressively into new areas, piquing fans’ interest who were not born when the mighty Purple machine ruled the music world’s money trees. Their holy grail of In Rock (1970) Machine Head (1972) and Made In Japan released in 1973 catapulted Deep Purple to the top in concert grosses and album sales around the world. Smoke On The Water ascended to mega-status — simply a perfect track.

Having amassed so many songs that get coined under the “classic” moniker, setlists have been a never-ending debate among diehards and newer fans. But Deep Purple have been more than in synch with fans’ tastes to remain a powerful drawing force since their formation in 1968.

These days, happy faces reside from both the stage and audience. When the music is this good, smiles reign supreme.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Deftones are an American alternative metal band from Sacramento, California. The band, which was founded in 1988, consists of Chino Moreno (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Stephen Carpenter (lead guitar), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion) and Sergio Vega (bass).
Deftones have released eight albums since their inception. Their debut album. Adrenaline, was released in 1995 after numerous lineup changes. 

Success was found with their second and third albums, Around the Fur and White Pony, including a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song "Elite". Their mainstream success continued with their self-titled album in 2003; however, sales were lackluster compared to White Pony. The follow-up, Saturday Night Wrist, was released in 2006 after a temporary falling out within the band due to creative tension between Moreno and producer Bob Ezrin. Its completion was also delayed by Moreno's drug addictions and the dissolution of his marriage.

In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled Eros, bassist Chi Cheng was involved in a traffic collision, leaving him in a minimally conscious state which ultimately led to his death in 2013. During that time, Deftones halted production on Eros and released Diamond Eyes and Koi No Yokan in 2010 and 2012, respectively, with current bassist Vega. In 2016, the band released a followup, titled Gore.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Their original name was Knight of Demon, but that was changed after a few weeks. They went from an Iron Maiden-esque sound to one heavily influenced by Venom in a matter of weeks.

In the early 90's Flemming Rönsdorf (Artillery) was asked to join Destruction as new vocalist. He rehearsed with the band, but didn't join because, according to Ronsdorf himself, the label didn't want to send him money in advance before the upcoming tour.

The releases between 1994 and 1998 have been disowned by the band and are now classed as "Neo-Destruction" and not part of their official discography.

Mike Sifringer was unable to perform at Portugal’s Caos Emergente festival in September 2009 due to a broken finger. Ol Drake of Evile took his place onstage.

Oliver Kaiser works as editor in Basle and gives for many years lessons in Musiclab. After leaving Destruction in 1999 he studies sociology, law & on the music academy.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Originally named DragonHeart, but changed their name because there was another power metal band (Dragonheart) using the same name.

ZP Theart left the band due to "insurmountable differences of musical opinion". His departure was announced on March 9th of 2010 by Herman Li.

Although the band is based in London, only Sam Totman, Marc Hudson, and former members Dave Mackintosh, Adrian Lambert and Diccon Harper are actually British (and Sam has lived most of his life in New Zealand). Herman Li is originally from Hong Kong, Vadim Pruzhanov is from Ukraine, bass player Frédéric Leclercq is French and Gee Anzalone is Italian. Ex-drummer Didier Almouzni is also French, while ex-vocalist ZP Theart is South African.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The legion of fiercely devoted DREAM THEATER diehards around the world expect nothing less than a smart, fully immersive, experiential journey through otherworldly soundscapes from each and every live performance, full-length album, and song.

Rightfully so, given the band’s three decades of continually redefining the parameters of hard rock and progressive heavy metal, overcoming obstacles, surpassing critical expectations, and resisting the incessant winds of industry uncertainty. Staying an exciting course in a sea littered with also-rans, pretenders, and opportunists, Dream Theater’s body of work endures with singular triumph.  

The Astonishing is undisputedly the most ambitious undertaking by a band whose cerebral compositions already define the vanguard of progressive hard rock. “This is the next natural step in our evolution,” declares longtime frontman James LaBrie. “This is a pinnacle moment for us. This is something we had to do.”

As instantly recognizable as Eddie, Vic Rattlehead, or the Misfits skull to those in the know, Dream Theater’s iconic Majesty symbol represents both the band and an entire lifestyle of strength through music and empowerment through expression. For their staunch determination, diverse compositions, and effortlessly authentic output, Dream Theater has been rewarded with Grammy nominations, over 12 million in worldwide album sales, and countless accolades from guitar, keyboard, drum, bass, and vocal publications, students, and aficionados in particular. They’ve shared stages with iconic institutions like Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Yes, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer (to name but a few). But most importantly, they’ve earned a fanbase whose loyalty, deep involvement, and passion is unmatched.

Dream Theater’s fans expect the best, always, and they welcome progression, change, and the pursuit of creative muses in equal measure. It’s this tireless devotion that’s allowed cofounders John Petrucci (guitar) and John Myung (bass), enduring cornerstones LaBrie (vocals) and Jordan Rudess (keys), and five-years-deep Mike Mangini (drums) to build a liberating creative environment where they seamlessly transition from the Rush-meets-Metallica shred of early ‘90s MTV hit “Pull Me Under,” to the Pink Floyd infused atmosphere of “Peruvian Skies,” to the 20 minute epic “The Count of Tuscany,” with some of their most inspired work erupting in just the past few years across modern, legacy-cementing platters A Dramatic Turn of Events (2011) and Dream Theater (2013).

Dream Theater’s first conceptually driven masterpiece, Metropolis Pt 2: Scenes from a Memory (1999), is spoken about by the Dream Theater faithful in the same reverent tones as cultural touchstone concept albums by The Who, Pink Floyd, Green Day, and Nine Inch Nails.

A sprawling, densely rich, fully realized world awaits within the band’s grandest concept album and most creatively courageous statement, The Astonishing. It’s a retro-futurist post-apocalyptic dystopia ruled by medieval style feudalism. It’s a place aching for a Chosen One to rise above the noise and defeat an Empire defined by the endless drone of noise machines and the illusion of safety in bland conformity. The Astonishing launches a brand new fantasy mythology, The Hunger Games buttressed against Game of Thrones, with an infusion of Escape from New York, all through the unique prism of Dream Theater. The new mythology was conceptualized and meticulously forged by Petrucci.

“He's a man of extreme focus,” Rudess says of the band’s guitarist, primary songwriter and lyricist. “He really dove into this, and from the moment he started on this, he was rewriting, doing research. It was a nonstop investment of his energy into the whole thing.”

“The whole experience was new. From the beginning, I knew the story needed to come together in order to set the tone for everything else,” explains Petrucci. “I had an idea a few years ago, while in Europe on a promo trip for the last album, which I put down on my phone. That was the seed. Jordan and I had a big library of musical ideas we’d collected, from each of us writing at home, or jamming together on the road backstage, but when it came to sitting down and putting it together, we took the story I had and scored the music around it.”

The Astonishing is enriched exponentially by the integration of a real orchestra and choir, arranged by conductor David Campbell, whose work graces over 450 gold and platinum albums, including watershed releases from Adele, Justin Timberlake, Linkin Park, Evanescence, Beyoncé, and his son, Beck. The Astonishing was produced by Petrucci with engineering and mixing by Richard Chycki, whose resume includes work with Rush, Aerosmith, and Mick Jagger. Other organic sounds are more abundant than at any point in the band’s history, with Rudess in particular relishing the tones from a grand piano and Hammond organ.

Like Tommy or The Wall, the songs on The Astonishing work as both singular compositions and overall story components. Writing the music as a duo, Petrucci and Rudess venture into unexplored corners of their sound without sacrificing their musical identity.

“You definitely start doing things you might not have done before, in service of the larger story. That was really exciting for Jordan and I,” says Petrucci. “Music is a very emotional art form. So to take elements of the plot, characters, and settings, translating those building blocks into musical pieces, it was exhilarating.”

“With a concept album, it’s all based around the characters. How powerful are they? How much can each of us relate to the characters and the story?” LaBrie adds. “John is a perfectionist. He is the kind of person to sit down and take as long as necessary to get things to a level we need to be in order for us to maintain who and what we are.”

LaBrie notes the band’s willingness to challenge themselves like never before and Rudess concurs: “This album has taken so much focus. It’s been a lot more work, more compositional focus musically and lyrically, than anything we’ve ever done.”

As Petrucci points out, The Astonishing is the culmination of everything that’s come before and the arrival of the purest, most complete realization of Dream Theater imaginable. The experimentation with form, structure, length; orchestration; with epic storytelling; everything Dream Theater has done since the group began finds its ultimate fulfillment here. As songwriters, as performers, as a collective unit, Dream Theater is now the definition of fully realized potential.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[After more than two million discs sold with a usual entry in the Top-10 album charts and sold out shows and headlining tours in 39 countries all over Europe, America, Asia and Australia, Germany‘s “most different“ are back with a vengeance with their tenth studio album “Space Police“.

From Donington to Tokyo, Los Angeles to Rio de Janeiro: in the last 15 years they literally played every significant Heavy Metal stage around the globe.

When Heavy Metal was pronounced dead in the early nineties, a bunch of German kids set out from the middle of nowhere to fight all odds and in doing so conquered the hearts of a whole new generation of fans around the globe.

Never trying to live up to expectations of the music industry, press and fans alike, Germany‘s most successful nineties born Heavy Metal act, paved their way by designing their own cosmos - defined by authenticity, tongues that are firmly planted in cheeks and last but not at least their ongoing love for guitar-driven anthemic powerful music; beyond trends and the pigeonhole of the Heavy Metal archetype.

22 years later, on their tenth album “Space Police“ (produced by Sascha Paeth at Gatestudio Wolfsburg) Edguy continue to make things their way. No other band in the universe could do an authentic cover version of the Falco classic “Rock Me Amadeus“, put it next to the heaviest Power Metal material the band has ever written, sum things up with the self-indulgent anthem “Love Tyger“ and: Get away with it...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Enthroned is a black metal band formed in Charleroi in 1993 by Cernunnos. He soon recruited guitarist Tsebaoth and a vocalist from grindcore/black metal band Hecate who stayed until the end of December 1993. Then bassist/vocalist Sabathan joined. The band released a five-track demo tape in mid-1994 which brought them to the attention of several independent labels. A 7-inch split EP with Ancient Rites was then released by the underground label Afterdark Records. After the label's demise, Evil Alliance Records (a sub-label of Osmose Productions) released Enthroned's first full-length release, Prophecies of Pagan Fire. Shortly thereafter, the band enlisted second guitarist Nornagest. Eventually, Tseboath was replaced by Nebiros.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In a restless world which demands permanent innovation and at the same time the preservation of tried and tested ideals, Evergrey are among the few bands who have succeeded in performing this difficult balancing act in artistic terms. Their intelligent dark melodic metal is marked by high compositional skill, their very own signature and a diversity which never ceases to amaze their audience. The songs by the band from Sweden are never one-dimensional or indeed predictable, but always accessible and based on clear concepts. As confident as we have known Evergrey for more than ten years, as convincing do the band present themselves on their latest album, Torn dynamic, powerful, and always haunting.

Their new album sees Englund & Co. continue a career which has been on the ascent for more than ten years. Since the band arrived on the scene in 1998, Evergrey have brought out six studio albums and one live cut. All of them made the top 20 in their native Sweden and the last two made the top 10 (no. 6 and 3, respectively). On top of that, their DVD was number 1 for four weeks and nominated for a Grammy in Sweden. The band has toured around the globe several times, together with In Flames, Nevermore, Throwdown, Arch Enemy, Children of Bodom and Iced Earth, among others.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[If you ask me, I really don’t think there has ever been a band like Evil Invaders. Their music? Well, it definitely sounds like Speed Metal, because of its fast and technical riffs and all… On the other hand, you definitely can hear some Heavy Metal and Thrash Metal influences too. It’s difficult to put a precise label on their music, really, but it doesn’t sound like a band from now at all. It really doesn’t. But yet it sounds kind of… well… new!

Imagine Evil Invaders was an upcoming band from the early 80’s. As if we were still living in the bay area where we could see Mustaine playing lead guitars in Metallica before there was even an album called Kill ‘em All. As if bands like Agent Steel, Exciter or Megadeth were still to become as they ended up to be.
Man… Do you recall those images or the feeling you had when you first saw bands like early Metallica, WASP or Mercyful Fate? Well, with Evil Invaders I think this feeling will be all coming back to you. Go to a show, check out their music and see for yourself...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The original architects of the thrash metal scene, EXODUS has battled every kind of adversity over the past 30 years and used it all as fuel to stoke their ever-raging fire. Short-lived trends, line-up shifts, label conflicts, even the death of founding vocalist Paul Baloff couldn’t stop the beast. And through it all, guitarist and songwriter Gary Holt has persevered with misanthropic indignation, rolling with the punches, reassembling the broken pieces and working with the eccentric personalities surrounding him to create some of the most trenchant, fast-paced, and unrelenting music that influenced everyone from Pantera to Lamb of God and continues to crush skulls at a time decades after most ‘80s thrash bands have retired.

With Blood In Blood Out, EXODUS’ tenth full-length studio album of new material, Holt, Hunting, Gibson, Altus, and Souza prove they still has the fortitude, chops, and talent to deliver top-notch, ballad-free tunes that stand out without straying from their band’s core aesthetic. The title of the album encapsulates Holt’s approach to EXODUS: “When I was working on the record, I was sitting around watching TV series like ‘Gangland’ and all these locked-up prison reality shows,” he says. “And I thought, ‘Yeah, that’s like EXODUS.’ It’s a brotherhood. You bleed to get in, you bleed to get out. I’ve been doing this kind of music since I was a teenager and I’ll be doing it ‘til I can’t physically do it anymore.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The legendary metal band Fates Warning began in the early 1980's playing a traditional style of heavy metal. However, they quickly began to adopt a more technically proficient style influenced by Rush and are considered by many to be the first true prog-metal band.

While the band has subsequently moved in more melodic and ambient directions, they have remained a vibrant and well-respected cornerstone for the prog camp within the heavy metal strata.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[With Genexus, Fear Factory forges a new hyper-alloy of sound, extreme and idea. “We wanted to create a new hybrid,” states guitarist and founding songwriter, Dino Cazares. “Something that summed up every aspect of who we are. Musically. Lyrically. You can hear the organic, the technological; the past and the future. It’s the next evolution of Fear Factory.” 

Genexus is the sound of Fear Factory in-extremis. Co-produced by the band with longtime collaborator, Rhys Fulber, and mixed by Andy Sneap (Testament, Killswitch Engage, Trivium), it’s Fear Factory bringing every weapon in its sonic arsenal to bear. From the concrete-breaking staccato riffs that open the record with “Autonomous Combat System” to the soaring melodies of “Dielectric” to the album’s elegiacal closer, “Expiration Date,” Genexus is an unforgiving and unforgettable statement from a band that has long pushed the boundaries of extreme music.

“We’ve always had a thirst for technology; whether it be in how we make our records or how we view the world,” says Cazares. “That’s always helped us stay a step ahead and remain relevant. That was the feeling we had when we started the band 25 years ago and that’s how we approach our music now. We’ve never wavered.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The group was founded in 1981 under the name Paradox by drummer Kelly David-Smith and guitarists Pete Mello and Dave Goulder, who were later joined by bassist Jason Newsted. Jason had answered a newspaper ad that Kelly had placed in the local newspaper looking for a bass player. Jason came to Phoenix with his band Gangster from Michigan on their way to California, but Gangster broke up while in Phoenix. Kelly got a call from a couple of his high school friends, Mark Vasquez and Kevin Horton, looking for some people to jam with playing covers of bands such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, MSG, and UFO. The band then morphed into “Dredlox” together with the new recruits, Jason was now the main vocalist.
Kelly saw “A.K.” (Eric A. Knutson) singing “The Goodbye Girl” at his high school talent show. In 1982 they were in the same summer school class and Kelly asked Knutson if he wanted to audition. They put him on 2-week probation and he later joined the band. Due to the provisional nature of his membership, the band referred to Knutson as “the 2 weeker.” Ed Carlson, from another local rival band called Exodus (not to be confused with the California Bay Area thrash metal band of the same name), also joined in 1983 after Kevin’s departure from the band. The name of the band changed into The Dogz, but it didn’t last long. Eventually the band renamed itself “Flotsam and Jetsam” after writing a song inspired by a chapter of J. R. R. Tolkien‘s The Two Towers.
The band made its live debuts in local clubs and in California and had the opportunity to play with bands such as Megadeth, Armored Saint, Alcatrazz, Malice, Exciter, Mercyful Fate, Riot andAutograph. In 1985 Mark Vasquez stepped out and 17-year-old Michael Gilbert joined the band. Flotsam and Jetsam released two demo tapes Iron Tears and Metal Shock in 1985.
They created their first video “Hammerhead” from the Metal Shock demo: “We taped it in Jason and Ed’s apartment living room. We also made a live video at the infamous Bootlegger in Phoenix”, (owned by Gloria Cavalera, currently married to Max Cavalera) These videos and the band’s demos made a good impression on record labels. After the band contributed to the Speed Metal Hell II and Metal Massacre VII compilations, they then signed a deal with Metal Blade Records.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In the distant future of the year 1992...war has returned to the galaxy. One thousand years have passed since the brave hero Angus McFife defeated the evil sorcerer Zargothrax in the battle of Dunfermline, trapping the wizard in a frozen prison of liquid ice. But now, a cult of unholy chaos wizards are plotting to release their dark master from his ice-bound tomb and once again unleash the sorcerer Zargothrax upon the universe. The tragic destiny of the Galactic Empire of Fife now hangs in the balance once more...

            <description><![CDATA[It has always been hard to put a tag on GOJIRA, one of France’s most extreme bands the country’s musical pallet has ever known. But then again, the band has never really sought out such a tag, instead letting the music do the talking, preferring introspection and intelligence over preconceived notions and preexisting tags. Ever since the 1996 formation in town of Bayonne in the southwest of France, GOJIRA has been an ever-evolving experiment in extreme metal ultimately built upon a worldly, ever-conscious outlook with roots firmly-planted both in the hippie movement and an environmentally-conscious, new age mentality. This time, with The Way of All Flesh, GOJIRA harnesses a spiritual consciousness as well, but still culminates in a sound wholly heavy.

Originally dubbed Godzilla, after the scaly, green film star with an equally huge reputation as the newfound band’s sound, the brothers Duplantier – guitarist/vocalist Joe and drummer Mario – and fellow Frenchmen Jean Michel Labadie on bass and Christian Andreu on guitar, quickly released several demos, ultimately changing the band’s name and independently releasing the first GOJIRA album, Terra Incognita, in 2001, offering up a brief glimpse into the giant GOJIRA would eventually become through persistent hard work and years of toiling in the metal underground.

After the 2003 release of the band’s follow-up, The Link, throughout Europe and the subsequent live DVD release the next year, of the aptly-titled The Link Alive, 2005 brought the release of From Mars To Sirius, the band’s breakthrough release, garnering high praise and a North American release through Prosthetic Records in 2006. Fans of not only heavy, extreme music took notice, but so did the intellectual world, thanks to Sirius’ thoughtful and expansive inner examination of the world at hand and the consequences of humanity’s struggle to coexist without harm. The metal world was amused and amazed: much of it hadn’t yet seen an equally intelligent and pummelingly heavy release that was as expansive and open as it was dense and concise.

Following the immense praise of From Mars To Sirius and recurring trips across the Atlantic for North American touring alongside the likes of Lamb of God, Children of Bodom, and Behemoth among others, GOJIRA established its stranglehold on the extreme metal spectrum with a linguist’s touch, a lyricist’s finesse, and a crushingly heavy live show that left audiences astounded, establishing the band’s live performance as a spot-on recreation of the band’s increasingly adept and intelligent studio output.

While 2007 wrapped with GOJIRA again touring North America on the Radio Rebellion Tour alongside Behemoth to the best reaction yet, the dawn of 2008 saw a nearly 10 month wait for while the band assembled The Way of All Flesh, one of the year’s most anticipated records. This time revolving around the undeniable dilemma of a mortal demise, GOJIRA’s soundtrack to the situation seems fitting. Shifting ever-so-slightly from the eco-friendly orchestra of impending doom on From Mars To Sirius to the band’s new message of the equally uncontrollable inevitability of death, The Way of All Flesh melds the open and airy progressive passages GOJIRA has become famous for with the sonically dense sounds and bludgeoningly heavy rhythms that makes the band an equally intelligent force as it is unmatchably heavy.

Featuring a guest vocal spot on “Adoration For None” from Lamb of God’s Randy Blythe – one of GOJIRA’s most vocal supporters from their first moment making an impression in the Americas – and the now familiar Morbid Angel-isms of The Way Of All Flesh’s title track join the angular riffing more akin to Meshuggah on “Esoteric Surgery” and the epic, artful plodding of the nearly 10-minute “The Art of Dying,” showing that GOJIRA have indeed opened a new bag of tricks for The Way Of All Flesh, while not abandoning the sound that first showed a massive promise of potential on Sirius.

“It’s more inventive than From Mars To Sirius and at the same time more straight to the point,” GOJIRA frontman Joe Duplantier says of The Way of All Flesh. “The whole album is about death, death is like a step on the path of the soul. The mystery surrounding this phenomenon is just so inspiring, and death is the most common thing on earth.”

“This album is also a ‘requiem’ for our planet,” Duplantier continues. “We don't want to be negative or cynical about the fate of humanity, but the situation on Earth is growing critical, and the way humans behave is so catastrophic that we really need to express our exasperation about it. It's not fear, but anger. But we still believe that consciousness can make a difference and that we can change things as human beings.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Multi­-state death metal project GRUESOME was born out of guitarist/vocalist Matt Harvey and drummer Gus Rios' mutual involvement with the Death To All tours (Harvey served as frontman for the original mini­-tour and Rios both performed “Baptized in Blood” and worked with DTA drummer Sean Reinert on the following US tour where Exhumed filled in as support). After discussing and discarding the idea of putting together another incarnation of DTA to focus exclusively on the first two albums, Harvey half­-jokingly suggested that the pair write their own songs in intentional homage to Death. It wasn't long before the idea gained traction, and the band soon had five tracks written. With Harvey writing in California, Rios recruited Possessed guitarist Daniel Gonzalez and Derketa bassist Robin Mazen to record the material in Florida, while Harvey tracked his vocals on the West Coast.

GRUESOME released a pair of single-­song demos in 2014, and was subsequently signed by Relapse Records in June of that year, with a full-­length release (recorded in Florida, of course) planned for early the next year. The result of those recordings would become the band’s debut full- length Savage Land, a truly gruesome slab of Leprosy-styled death metal released in April 2015. It’s clear from the song quality on Savage Land that GRUESOME is humbly determined to keep Death’s classic sound alive as faithfully as possible, and the critical acclaim for Savage Land has reflected the band’s dedication. Metal Injection called Savage Land “the advanced, dripping-­rot-from-­the-­corners-­of-­a-­coffin, putrid, vile death metal throwback that you’ve been waiting for,” while Exclaim declared that “the enthusiasm alone on Savage Land is awe­-inspiring.”

After the positive reception of Savage Land, GRUESOME knew they wanted to continue further with their tribute, and decided that any true Death tribute band would have to sink its teeth into the undiluted savagery of Death's early material. Their forthcoming EP reflects that sentiment: produced by the band and co-produced / recorded with Jarrett Pritchard at New Constellation Studios RMP in Orlando, FL, Dimensions of Horror is a gruesome salute to Death's iconic Scream Bloody Gore and once again features cover art by the legendary Ed Repka (Death, Atheist, Massacre). A six-song slab of grisly, bone-breaking death metal jams, Dimensions Of Horror continues the development of GRUESOME's homage to the founding fathers of the genre and proves that no matter the decade, old-school death metal is always relevant, always brutal, and always irresistible. With an all- star lineup and unmatched songwriting skills, GRUESOME is willing and able to propel the historical sentiment and sincerity of Death’s spirit into the present.

GRUESOME is:
Daniel Gonzalez ­- Guitar
Matt Harvey ­- Guitar, vocals
Robin Mazen ­- Bass
Gus Rios ­- Drums]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[After quitting Ceremonial Oath, Oscar Dronjak and Jesper Strömblad formed HammerFall with Niklas Sundin and Mikael Stanne, who are both members of Dark Tranquillity.

As they were all involved in other bands, HammerFall was relegated to be a side project for several years. Their concerts were limited mostly to a local music contest named Rockslaget.

In 1996, HammerFall reached the semi-finals of Rockslaget. Since vocalist Mikael Stanne was not going to be able to perform with the band on the semi-finals, through mutual friends, they got in contact with Joacim Cans, who agreed to play with them for the night. The concert was a success, despite the fact that the judges didn't qualify HammerFall for the finals. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.

In early 1997, German label Nuclear Blast Records approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release deal, which included four albums. Towards the end of 1997, "Glory to the Brave" was released in Japan and the United States. Sales of the album reached one hundred thousand copies. HammerFall were also nominated for the Swedish Grammy award in the Best Hard Rock act category.

Their first world tour took place in October 1998, after the release of "Legacy of Kings". During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection which made it impossible for him to sing. Shortly afterwards, Magnus Rosén was afflicted with the same disease, and after him the whole of HammerFall's support crew became sick. The members of the band played for as long as possible and then were forced to postpone or cancel a few dates. By the end of that tour, drummer Patrik Räfling left the band, and Anders Johansson joined the band.

Following the release of "Renegade", the reviews were mostly positive, even though there was a consensus that the band's sound was remarkably different. A music video was made for the title track, and reached the top of the Swedish parade; the same soon happened with the album itself, which reached gold status with over forty thousand copies sold.

After releasing "Crimson Thunder", HammerFall's tour was brought to a sudden end when Oscar Dronjak suffered a motorcycle accident, breaking his left arm and sustaining several minor injuries. They were then left with no choice but to take a break.

Their 6th album, titled "Threshold", was released on October 20, 2006 and it went directly to a number 1 position on the Swedish charts.

On March 6, 2007, a statement was posted online at HammerFall's official website (and his own official website), that bassist Magnus Rosén would not be involved with the band anymore, stating that he was unhappy in the band and wanted to focus on other projects. He has since released a few solo albums that are comprised mostly of bass playing and also joined Tony Martin's band. 

Notable compilation appearances:
"Head Over Heels" (featuring Udo Dirkschneider) on a 1999 Accept tribute CD.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Few could have envisioned the bright future that the Norns had in store for HEIDEVOLK back in 2002. Since its inception in Arnhem (the Netherlands) thirteen years ago, HEIDEVOLK came, saw, and conquered stages throughout Europe with their very own brand of folk metal. Instantly recognizable dual clean male vocals and irresistibly catchy songs have ignited the pagan fire in the souls of many on the continent. They deliver their songs on divine matters and profane pleasures with equal integrity, fueled by a folkloric fire and pagan pride. With a repertoire ranging from epic to raging, captivating live shows and an undying desire to perform, HEIDEVOLK has become a familiar face Europe and North America. HEIDEVOLK stands for an uncompromising attitude, intense shows, and the transcendence of barriers between performer and audience… even if your Dutch sucks!In 2005, HEIDEVOLK released its first CD, “De strijdlust is geboren”, followed by the “Wodan Heerst” EP in 2007. Both releases were re-released on one CD by Napalm Records in 2008. The sophomore full-length CD ‘Walhalla Wacht’ (Napalm Records) also saw its worldwide release in 2008. The internationally well received and more mature third full-length, “Uit oude grond” (2010), set a new standard. With their folkish roots and raw energy combined HEIDEVOLK made their most varied release so far. The more powerful and aggressive concept album about the revolt of the Batavian tribe against the Roman Empire, BATAVI (2012), was released two years later. BATAVI opened new doors for the band with their much anticipated and highly successful first North American tour as a direct result (PAGANFEST MEX/USA/CAN). Now, 3 years later HEIDEVOLK presents you with their most epic and melodic album yet. The stunning masterpiece: VELUA.With VELUA, the band accompanies you on a journey through a world of myths and legends set against the backdrop of the most beautiful part of nature in the Netherlands and namesake of this album, the Veluwe.
VELUA brings you the wondrous, gruesome and weird tales about murderous brigands, deceiving wraiths, cursed souls and evil-minded goblins that roam the woods at night. Along with this dark folklore it sings the praises of the undying beauty of nature and the embers of early pagan traditions.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The original name of the band formed in 1985 was Purgatory but was later changed to Iced Earth before they released their last demo.

Gene Adam was originally going to perform on "Night of the Stormrider". Jon Schaffer was concerned that Adam wouldn't be able to handle the vocal melodies for the new material and asked him to take singing lessons. Adam refused and as a result he was replaced by John Greely. Greely was later ejected from the band too. 

Shortly after the release of "Night of the Stormrider", Jon Schaffer went on strike against Century Media Records, refusing to provide them with new recordings (as expected based on their contract), as allegedly they had not paid him any royalties from the first two albums. 

The situation was eventually resolved and after a three-year hiatus the band returned with Matthew Barlow as the new vocalist. Schaffer and Barlow are brothers-in-law. Matt is married to Jon's sister. 

Although Keith Menser is listed as having played bass on "The Dark Saga", he did not actually record a note on the album. When Dave Abell left the band and Mark Prator's friend Menser was recruited, the album had already been recorded and so Menser was to play bass on the tour.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[IN MOURNING was formed in the Swedish woods in the year 2000. Since then the band has evolved over the years striving to refine its sound to what it is today. April 2012 marked the release of the bands third and latest album "The Weight Of Oceans", a mythology inspired conceptual story that journeys to the sea. Musically blending a broad spectrum of influences into a foundation of melodic death metal. Thrusting from doomy metal-riffs, blasting drumbeats and deep growling vocals to calm breezes of clean flowing melodies and harmonies.

After the release of "The Weight Of Oceans" the band parted ways with drummer Christian Netzell (also Volturyon, Spasmodic etc.) to later be joined by former Katatonia drummer Daniel Liljekvist. Now hitting the recording studio with new spark in late 2015 to write a new chapter together with Polish record label Agonia Records!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Iron Maiden are an institution. Over the course of nearly 40 years they have come to embody a spirit of fearless creative independence, ferocious dedication to their fans, and a cheerful indifference to their critics that’s won them a following that spans every culture, generation, and time-zone. A story of gritty determination and courageous defiance of the naysayers, theirs has been an adventure like no other, and with the rapturous receipt of their 16th studio album they’re showing no signs of slowing down. 

An album that neatly encapsulates Iron Maiden’s huge creative range, The Book Of Souls is nothing less than a 92-minute masterpiece - a cannon-blast of exuberant, anthemic bravado that serves as cast-iron confirmation of just how much they have left in the tank. From the infectious, stadium-skewering hooks of The Red And The Black to the lofty ambition of the 18-minute Empire Of The Clouds, it’s the artistic summation of everything that’s given Iron Maiden such deep resonance and universal appeal. 

Like the breathless excitement and scale of their stage shows, their remarkable new double-album is emblematic of a stout-hearted refusal to do anything by half-measures and an irrepressible sense of fun.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The band Freight was formed by schoolmates Kenneth "K.K." Downing and Ian Hill in 1969. They quickly found drummer John Ellis, and decided that they needed a vocalist. In 1970, a band called Judas Priest had broken up, and Al Atkins was out of a job. He was quickly hired by Ian and K.K., who then renamed their band Judas Priest since the name was available. A demo was recorded in July, 1971, and the band opened for acts like Budgie and Slade.

In 1971, drummer Alan "Skip" Moore came in for a brief while, and was then replaced by Chris "Congo" Campbell. Al Atkins left in early 1973. Campbell thought the band had little future and left too. The band nearly broke up, before Ian Hill's girlfriend Sue suggested her brother Rob for a vocalist. He arrived in May 1973, bringing his Hiroshima bandmate, drummer John Hinch with him.

In April, 1974, Glenn Tipton of the Flying Hat Band came in as second guitarist, and an album, Rocka Rolla, was recorded for Gull Records. Gull wanted the band to add a horn section, but mercifully they refused, honing their guitar driven attack instead. In the fall of 1975, Hinch was fired for incompetence, and "Skip" Moore returned. The band recorded the legendary "Sad Wings of Destiny" album, and were signed by CBS records. Moore left, and session drummer Simon Phillips appeared on the Sin After Sin album.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The passing of time brings longer shadows and darker thoughts to the human mind. Melancholy’s cry is never far from our ears, even in the happiest of times. But while there is no true answer to the meaning of our brief lives, music will always be a reliable and trustworthy companion through fear and uncertainty. Perhaps more than any other contemporary band, Katatonia have long displayed a masterful propensity for expressing the tears and torments of mortality, offering sumptuous glimmers of sonic hope to soothe our troubled souls. In 2016, Stockholm’s widely celebrated soldiers of sorrow will once again stir the blood and embolden our hearts with a brand new album that promises to further cement their already unassailable reputation.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Kim Bendix Petersen (born 14 June 1956, Copenhagen, Denmark), better known by his stage name King Diamond , is a Danish heavy metal musician. As a vocalist, he is known for his extensive vocal range, in particular his usage of falsetto. He is the lead vocalist for both Mercyful Fate and the eponymous King Diamond. Metallica has performed an 11-minute tribute to Mercyful Fate. It features five of their songs. When James Hetfield sings it, he does not sing in a falsetto like King Diamond, but in 2008 (and again in 2011, with Hank Shermann, Michael Denner and Timi Hansen) King Diamond performed "Mercyful Fate" with Metallica, and put the screams in where necessary.

King has been on the covers of many rock and metal magazines and influenced many artists including Metallica's Lars Ulrich, Cradle of Filth, Cage, and Andy DiGelsomina of the Wagnerian opera metal project Lyraka. American heavy metal band Cage devoted him "King Diamond" song (album "Hell Destroyer", 2007).]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Formed in 1993, first as Shamaani Duo and later as Shaman. The name was changed to Korpiklaani in 2003 to reflect the band's change in direction and English lyrics (and according to Jonne Järvelä also to avoid confusion with the Brazilian power metal band Shaman), even if since their fourth album they have been writing mostly in Finnish. "Korpiklaani" is Finnish for "Clan of the Wilderness".

Juha Jyrkäs (previously credited as Virva Holtiton) provides many of Korpiklaani's lyrics, and has made guest appearances on a few songs playing kantele and contributing yoik vocals.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Combine extreme music with an edgy, biting implacability, complement it with politically motivated lyrics that have a distinct tendency to point the finger at grievances and aren't afraid of exposing abhorrent facts, and you just might get a sense of the pandemonium of sounds on Hordes of Chaos, the latest recording by Germany's cult thrash metal act, Kreator, scheduled for release on Steamhammer/SPV on 19 January 2009 (Germany: 16 January, US: late January). Even in 2009, the band prove themselves to be unusually innovative and a step ahead of the game, always ready to pursue new ideas and treat themselves and their fans to maximum authenticity. Frontman Mille Petrozza, along with drummer Jürgen 'Ventor' Reil, bassist Christian Giesler and guitarist Sami Yli-Sirniö, recorded ten hard-as-nails tracks in the summer of 2008, songs with a persistent and unmistakable message - Kreator are experts when it comes to pure, unadulterated thrash metal.

In terms of content and composition, Hordes of Chaos takes up where its predecessor, Enemy of God (2005), left off. Petrozza, who again offers his points of view for public discussion, explains, "The global political situation has come apart at the seams. The Eastern and Western Blocs no longer exist, and today it's a case of dog eat dog." Petrozza considers the album's raw, in-your-face approach "a warning to the coming generation. Everybody has to go their own path in life and should try not to buy into the propaganda lies that governments feed us.

Hordes of Chaos was recorded at Berlin's Tritonus studios under the direction of producer Moses Schneider. Schneider is renowned for his fresh and exceptionally dynamic working methods with bands and artists such as Tocotronic and Beatsteaks. "We consciously decided on Moses as our producer for the live recording of the basic tracks at the studio," says Petrozza. "This was the first time since Pleasure to Kill that we worked in this fashion. The new album is a 100% realistic reflection of Kreator's live qualities. Instead of exploring every little detail to sterile perfection with the help of computer technology, this time around we wanted to deliver as dynamic of a production as possible. There can be no doubt that we've achieved our target in Hordes of Chaos." The album was mixed in London by Colin Richardson (of Slipknot, Bullet for my Valentine, Cradle of Filth fame).

The result is exactly what one would expect from Kreator in terms of its energy and stylistic direction. Hordes of Chaos brilliantly conveys the same intense energy that Kreator is known for in their live stage shows. "We play our music just the way it was played in the seventies," says Petrozza, whom rigorously despises any artificial cosmetics added through sound distorting studio tricks. "The problem is that nowadays, even the worst groups can sound great, thanks to computer mastering. We don't want that. We want to sound natural and record the album just as it was done in the past.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Members in order from left to right: Masayuki Suzuki, Masayoshi Yamashita, Minoru Niihara, and Akira Takasaki.

Loudness was formed in 1981 by Akira Takasaki, Munetaka Higuchi, and Hiroyuki Tanaka who were transitioning from rock band Lazy to trying their hand at a heavy metal band, unhappy with the musical direction of Lazy. Shortly after formation however Tanaka quit the band to pursue a career in anime soundtracks with the band Neverland. In turn Takasaki recruited childhood friend Masayoshi Yamashita as the new bassist and shortly after hired frontman Minoru Niihara formerly of Earthshaker through an audition.

In 1985 following the band's first North American and European tours Twisted Sister's co-manager Joe Gerber helped Loudness ink a deal with Atco Records. This was the first time in history that a Japanese heavy metal band had signed with an American label, or toured the US, and under Atco, the band released their American debut "Thunder in the East" which was met with good sales and commercial success reaching #74 on the Billboard 200 and remained there for 23 weeks, also a first for a Japanese metal band. After two more albums and two more billboard appearances, producer Max Norman suggested that the band hire an English speaking vocalist which would end up being Michael Vescera. Vescera would serve as vocalist for the next two Loudness albums before leaving in 1991 to join Yngwie J. Malmsteen.

Following a steady decline in popularity through the Vescera era, Loudness returned to Japan where Masayoshi Yamashita also left the band. He was replaced by Taiji Sawada of X Japan fame. But by 1993 Sawada quit to form Dirty Trashroad followed by founding member Munetaka Higuchi who joined Niihara's new band Sly leaving Takasaki as the only original member left. Later that year Loudness introduced replacement members Masaki Yamada and Hirotsugu Homma of Ezo on vocals and drums, and finally Naoto Shibata, band leader of Anthem on bass essentially turning Loudness into a supergroup. This lineup would release three albums before Yamada indicated his desire to leave the band in 2000.

Before leaving, Yamada suggested that Loudness hold a reunion tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and by 2001 Higuchi, Niihara, and Yamaguchi had all returned to the lineup where they would remain for the next 7 years until the death of Munetaka Higuchi which was mourned greatly throughout Japan.

In 2009 the band indicated that they wouldn't be disbanding despite the passing of Higuchi and hired Masayuki Suzuki to fill the void left due to Higuchi's passing. Loudness remains active to date.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Machine Head is an American heavy metal band from Oakland, California. Formed on October 12, 1991, the group was founded by vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn and bassist Adam Duce. The current lineup of the band comprises Flynn, drummer Dave McClain, guitarist Phil Demmel, and bassist Jared MacEachern. Machine Head is one of the pioneering bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. 

Machine Head was formed by member Robb Flynn, previously part of the bands Forbidden and Vio-lence. Flynn felt musically unfulfilled with Vio-lence and requested to start a side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Adam Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV'sHeadbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums.
The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label Roadrunner Records, when controversy surrounding Machine Head's fourth album Supercharger (released 3 weeks after September 11, 2001) resulted in their songs and music video for the song "Crashing Around You" (which featured burning buildings) being pulled from all media outlets. The band re-signed with Roadrunner soon after and has released four albums since, 2003's Through the Ashes of Empires, 2007's The Blackening (which earned Machine Head its first Grammy Award nomination) and 2011's Unto the Locust. Their most recent album, Bloodstone & Diamonds, was released in 2014. Machine Head have sold over 3 million records worldwide.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In the 1970s Joey DeMaio was a bass tech for Black Sabbath and played with David "Rock" Feinstein in David Feinstein's Thunder. He met Ross the Boss while on tour with Black Sabbath ("We met on English ground...") and Manowar were formed.

According to the band's official biography, Scott Columbus was such a ferocious drummer in his prime that normal drumsets would shatter by the end of a gig. This lead to the use of custom, stainless steel drumsets to avoid costly replacements for every show.

When the band "inked" a deal with Megaforce Records in 1983 (Music for Nations in the UK), the contract was signed in their own blood to mark the occasion.

Scott Columbus left Manowar between "Kings of Metal" and "The Triumph of Steel", the reason stated at the time being to care for his ill son. He rejoined in time for 1996's "Louder than Hell" along with new guitarist Karl Logan. Columbus was missing from the Manowar line-up since 2008 due to unspecified "personal tragedies." Rhino filled in on tour in 2008 and Donnie Hamzik returned to take his place in 2009 before Columbus confirmed in 2010 that he had left permanently. He also stated at this point that his son was never ill at the time of his first departure.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Art is a cyclical beast. The same can easily be said of Grammy Award nominated hard rock juggernaut Mastodon. The group’s four members recognize the importance of life’s omnipresent cycles on their sixth full-length album, Once More ‘Round the Sun. The band orbits around themes of loss and rebirth, twirling a sonic spiral of its signature robust riffing, hypnotically haunting soundscapes, triage of dynamic voices, and thundering seismic grooves. At the same time, this particular collection proves personal for Brann Dailor, Brent Hinds, Bill Kelliher, and Troy Sanders. The very title says something slightly different for each member.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Megadeth is an American thrash metal band from Los Angeles, California. The group was formed in 1983 by guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson, shortly after Mustaine's dismissal from Metallica. A pioneer of the American thrash metal scene, the band is credited as one of the genre's "big four" with Anthrax, Metallica and Slayer, responsible for thrash metal's development and popularization. Megadeth plays in a technical style, featuring fast rhythm sections and complex arrangements; themes of death, war, politics and religion are prominent in the group's lyrics.

In 1985, the band released its debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the independent label Combat Records. The album's moderate commercial success caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and influenced the underground metal scene. Despite its prominence in thrash metal, frequent disputes between its members and substance abuse issues brought Megadeth negative publicity during this period.

After the lineup stabilized, the band released a number of platinum-selling albums, including Rust in Peace (1990) and Countdown to Extinction (1992). These albums, along with touring worldwide, helped bring public recognition to Megadeth. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled with Mustaine out of court and rejoined the group in 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since mid-2005.

As of 2014, Megadeth has sold 50 million records worldwide, earned platinum certification in the United States for five of its fifteen studio albums, and received eleven Grammy nominations. The band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and, since 2010, in live shows. The group has experienced controversy over its musical approach and lyrics, including canceled concerts and album bans. MTV has refused to play two of the band's videos that the network considered to condone suicide.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Heavy Metal is more than a genre, more than an attitude, and certainly more than whatever cheap epithets are dismissively thrown at it by clueless critics. At its best, Metal is a lifestyle, a community, a tribe uniting people across cultural, economic, and philosophical divides with the primal pulse of bombastic and majestic expression. Never before has one entity encapsulated so many components of the heavy metal community’s continued vibrancy and dedication to the lifestyle than the collective fittingly called METAL ALLEGIANCE. 

Like the comic book heroes of The Avengers franchise, the men and women who’ve assembled on the stage and in the studio as METAL ALLEGIANCE come and go as they please, but each arrive armed with unique mythologies and classic discographies of their own, converging with mutual respect and a collaborative spirit. The result is a continuously evolving musical force both serious in its proficiency and celebratory in its enthusiasm and camaraderie.

            <description><![CDATA[Originally, Metal Church was formed in 1980 under the name Shrapnel in San Francisco by Kurdt Vanderhoof and others. Lars Ulrich (Metallica) also played in the band in 1981 on a few rehersals but didn't make it into the band, and so he is not considered as one of the past-members. This lineup released a few demos but nothing else. In 1981, Kurdt moved to Washington State and found Craig, Duke, and for a while Tom Weber on drums. Tom was quickly replaced by Kirk Arrington and this lineup recorded an instrumental demo.

After a few unsuccessful vocalist experiences, they found David Wayne, and released the "Four Hymns" demo in 1982. Further demo material from just before and just after Wayne was hired was also recorded though never officially released at the time was made available for free download after being unearthed over 20 years later.

"Four Hymns" got them a recording deal, which prompted Shrapnel to change their name to Metal Church and led to recording two albums. After "The Dark" in 1986, Kurdt Vanderhoof left and was replaced for half a tour by Mark Baker, and then by John Marshall as permanent guitarist. Kurdt would stay much involved in the songwriting process. In 1988, David Wayne left and was replaced by Mike Howe, with whom the next three albums were recorded. In 1994 the band broke up, but reformed in 1998 after finding some tapes from 1986 and releasing a live album. The lineup was David Wayne, Kurdt Vanderhoof, John Marshall, and Brian Wade and Jeff Lake on bass and drums, respectively. This lineup put out the Masterpeace album, and toured once. David Wayne then left the band and was replaced by Ronny Munroe. 

Even though Kurdt Vanderhoof didn't record or tour with Metal Church after 1987, he was still considered a part of the band and wrote a lot of their material.

David Wayne passed away on 5/10/2005.It has been reported that he was found dead outside his house on this date, the cause being reported as complications of injuries sustained in a head-on car accident a few months prior.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Upon forming Motörhead in 1975, bassist and vocalist Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister already had quite a lengthy career behind him - most of it as a guitarist. After short stints in Manchester outfits The Rainmakers (1963-1966) and Motown Sect (1966), he joined The Rocking Vicars on guitars. Releasing four singles and achieving popularity in northern England, they earned the distinction of being the first band to play behind the Iron Curtain - in Yugoslavia - and were invited, oddly enough, as special guests to a state banquet with President Marshall Tito.

Quitting the band in '67, Lemmy became a roadie for Jimi Hendrix for about six months, developing an interest in acid-rock which he indulged when he joined his next band, Sam Gopal's Dream, on guitars in '68. Led by the tabla-playing Gopal, the band released an album with Lemmy, who quit a year later, and found himself in the psychedelic Opal Butterfly throughout 1970. 

In 1971 he joined the psychedelic rock band Hawkwind. After being fired from Hawkwind in 1975, Lemmy recruited Larry Wallis and Lucas Fox to form "Bastard" who soon changed their name to Motorhead. This was a rather interesting decision for Lemmy, as the actual SONG Motorhead was originally a Hawkwind track; it would be the last song that Lemmy Kilmister would ever write for Hawkwind. Unfortunately, the track itself never made it to any of the Hawkwind albums (save for the B-side of a 7 inch single entitled "Kings Of Speed"), however the track was included as a bonus cut on Hawkwind's "Warrior On The Edge Of Time" reissue in 1992 (and again in 1994, when Griffin Music reissued the album on CD again). The most interesting thing about Hawkwind's version of "Motorhead" was the use of fiddle, violin and other spacey effects.

Lucas Fox was fired in 1975 reportedly due to his unreliability and lack of aggression in his drumming style. He was replaced with Phil Taylor who was an acquaintance of Lemmy's. In 1976, it was decided that the band needed another guitarist. They rehearsed with Eddie Clarke and found him a good fit. Immediately Larry Wallis announced his retirement from the band so he could concentrate on the other band he was involved with, Pink Fairies. 

Eddie Clarke left the band mid-tour in 1982 after he felt that the band had compromised its principles by recording a cover of Stand by Your Man by Tammy Wynette. Clarke refused to play on the cover. A replacement was quickly found in Brian Robertson who was touring solo in Canada (Motörhead were touring in the USA) and was brought in with a contract for one album and two singles. Robertson's stage attire and refusal to play classic Motörhead songs led to frictions in the band and the band agreed on his departure in 1984.

After Robertson's departure, the band advertised for a new guitarist and found two, Phil Campbell and Mick "Würzel" Burston. After the recording of Another Perfect Day, Phil Taylor left Motörhead to join with Robertson in his newly formed band. Phil Campbell knew Pete Gill, formerly of Saxon, and he was hired to replace Taylor.

In 1987 when Lemmy was filming the movie, Eat the Rich, Pete Gill left the band and Phil Taylor came back into the fold to appear in a cameo in the film. He would be out of the band again in 1992 during the recording of March or Die. He couldn't learn the drum tracks to the songs. Tommy Aldridge was brought in as a replacement on the album and Mickey Dee on full time replacement. He also appears on the track, Hellraiser.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[MY SLEEPING KARMA is a German Instrumental Quatuor that takes you into a mind-blowing sonic experience. Their music is a trip. They are no beginners, no amateurs,and when they hop on stage they make you forget about everything around you: they take you by the hand into the deepest and hidden corners of your very soul. The fourth album "Soma" follows the band’s own individualistic and atmospheric path towards enlightenment. 

Following the meaning of the album title ("Soma" is the intoxicating drink of the gods), the instrumental Psychedelic Groove Rock of the German quartet enhances the consciousness in a truly hypnotic and bewitching manner. The multilayered compositions move skilfully between heavy rock riffs and enchanting melodic parts with a high level of calmness and beauty. My Sleeping Karma "Soma" offers the perfect movie soundtrack to everybody’s own inner journey. Just be warned, you may never want to leave again!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[What makes NAPALM DEATH so special? Well, let’s think back 30 years: Would you have thought that a grindcore band from Birmingham would ever make it into the official album charts with some of the most infernal noise ever put on tape, enter the Guinness book for the shortest song ever recorded or appear in a prominent UK TV series named “Skins”? That it would be part of an Alice Cooper hosted episode of BBC’s Never Mind the Buzzcocks to guess from a couple of look-alikes who is the singer in NAPALM DEATH? Could you have ever imagined a down-to-earth lad named Mark “Barney” Greenway, a soccer fan (Aston Villa F.C.), vegetarian, prog metal freak and one of music history’s most renowned representatives of “cookie monster” style vocals would become a personality within the extreme music realm that is not about beer-drinking and hell-raising but synonymous with sounding hard while being smart? Well, that is where we are at now. From filthy, sweaty rehearsal rooms and tiny clubs and pubs NAPALM DEATH has conquered every music festival you can think of and toured through corners of the world a lot of bands would not even dare to tour while becoming famous for combining brutal music with political engagement and ethical values beyond the usual cliché of sex, drugs & rock n roll.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.

Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and Century Child (2002). Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the band's breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, "Wish I Had an Angel" (2004), received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Heavy Metal is not just about music: it's a way of life, a motivating mind-set, a positive force and an inspirational belief system. It's the most exciting, life-affirming noise that exists on this planet of ours, and London's indestructible masters of the furious form are Orange Goblin. Not just the UK's reigning champions of balls-out, party-starting, booze-fuelled metal, but one of the very best live rock bands of all time, the mighty Goblin have been a permanent and universally admired fixture on the British metal circuit for the past 18 years. 

With 2012’s ‘A Eulogy for the Damned', their seventh and best studio album, they cemented their place amongst the British metal elite. The album is a thunderous tour-de-force of gargantuan riffs, subterranean rumble and electrifying energy, it is the album the band had been threatening to make since they first crawled, from the grubby Soho shadows back in 1995.]]></description>

This new German force in the Melodic Metal realm is said to be one of the most inventive new bands and the big zines' journalists praise the masterly and unique mixture of traditional Power Metal with modern elements, folk and progressive influences as well as elements from the Gothic genre. ORDEN OGAN know perfectly how to create an atmospheric depth, normally only created by exceptional artists like Savatage. But does that fit together? Absolutely!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Overkill were formed in New Jersey when a previous D.D. Verni/Rat Skates (real names: Carlos Verni and Lee Kundrat - the stage names were tributes to favourite punk bands, the Ramones featuring Dee Dee Ramone, and the Damned, featuring Rat Scabies... Bobby Blitz was taken from The Dead Boys' Johnny Blitz! project) punk band called The Lubricunts, broke up in 1980. (There's a picture of the Lubricunts demo cover in the Wrecking Your Neck liner notes.) D.D. quickly wanted to form a new band, so he put out an ad which was answered by guitarist Robert "Riff Thunder" Pisarek (who came up with the name Overkill), but he was quickly replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony Ammendola.

Early covers (especially those done under the Virgin Killer name in the very very early days) were punk songs for the most part, including selections by the Ramones, and The Dead Boys. By 1980, they had recruited two guitarists (names forgotten over time) and the setlist included songs by Motörhead ("Overkill", half of the Ace of Spades album, and others), Judas Priest ("Tyrant" was their closer for a while), and later Iron Maiden and Riot, as well as a smattering of punk covers, which were played with extra distortion, intensity, and concentration on riffs.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Pantera was formed in 1981 by brothers Darrell Lance Abbott and Vincent Paul Abbott. They started out as a KISS-influenced glam band. They added bassist Rex Brown, and changed their names to Diamond Darrell, Vinnie Paul and Rex Rocker, respectively. They found vocalist Donnie Hart, who sang for a few rehearsals, and then Terry Lee Glaze. With the help of Jerry Abbott, Darrell and Vinnie's father, known as "The Eld'n" or "The Elder" (who was a famous country-music producer, and owned a studio), they put out their first album, "Metal Magic", in 1983. The first three albums in fact were on "Metal Magic Records", and were all self-produced.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Thirteen albums into Paradise Lost's 20+ year career, namedropping is pointless. The only band they can and should be held up against for comparison and consideration is Paradise Lost. With a career dating back to 1988, and their official recording debut in 1990 (Lost Paradise), the band has been riding and rollercoaster of highs and lows that began in earnest with their fourth album, Icon, in 1993. It presented Paradise Lost as a band that had more to offer beyond their established doom-death metal sound, driving the point home in 1995 with Draconian Times, an album that is considered to be a goth metal benchmark to this very day. 

That they would follow their international breakthrough with a slide into the realms of electronica only two years later (One Second) boggled the collective mind of Paradise Lost’s devout fanbase, yet their new direction earned a following of its own. The band made a gradual return to the swamp that spawned them, however, beginning with 2002’s Symbol Of Life. Elements of their favoured doom-goth sound grew consistently darker and louder with each album that followed, and each time the curiosity as to how far Paradise Lost would take this comeback grew.

It’s fair to say the band’s new outing, Tragic Idol, is the album fans of the Icon and Draconian Times era have been waiting on the edge of their seats for.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Paramore is an American rock band from Franklin, Tennessee, formed in 2004. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist Taylor York. The group released its debut album All We Know Is Falling in 2005, with the album reaching number eight on the UK Rock Chart and number thirty on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart.

The band's second album, Riot!, was released in 2007. Due to the success of the singles "Misery Business", "crushcrushcrush", and "That's What You Get", Riot! was a mainstream success and was certified Platinum in the United States. They then received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Their 2009 follow-up, Brand New Eyes, is the band's second-highest charting album to date, landing at number two on the Billboard 200 with 175,000 first week sales. It produced the top-forty single "The Only Exception" and went platinum in Ireland and the UK, as well as gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[1]

Following the departure of Josh and Zac Farro in 2010, the band released their self-titled fourth album in 2013. It gave the band their first career number one on the US Billboard 200 and was also the number one album in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.[2] It included the singles "Still Into You" and "Ain't It Fun", with the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for Hayley Williams and Taylor York as songwriters, making it Paramore's first Grammy win. Bassist Jeremy Davis left the band in December 2015.]]></description>

Within its first, this D.C. band is largely regarded as pioneering not one but two subgenres of hard rock. At the onset of the 1970’s, they helped procreate a behemoth called, “Heavy Metal.” Nine years on, they’d be planting the dark seed of what would grow to be known as “Doom.” 2011 marks the 40th Anniversary of this American treasure and see the release of their new album, Last Rites, on Metal Blade Records.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Picture was the very first Dutch hardrock band with a "record deal". With a history of 7 released albums world-wide and extensive tours throughout Europe with a.o. AC/DC, Saxon, Ted Nugent, Rose Tattoo and April Wine, everybody understands the past of Picture. 

Back in 1979 (30 years ago) the story of Picture began. Classic songs like Heavy Metal Ears, Diamond dreamer, Bombers and Eternal Dark (covered later by Swedish metal giants Hammerfall) and highly energetic live performances made Picture a very successful band. Picture paved the way for all other successful Dutch hardrock bands that followed in their footsteps soon afterwards. 

In many countries in the world Picture is treated as a cult band and when the long anticipated reunion finally happened at the beginning of 2008, many invitations to play on big (foreign) festivals followed soon. A limited edition live CD was being recorded and from December 2008 until January 2009 the band retreated in the StarSound Studios in Utrecht (Holland) to record their new studio album "Old Dogs New Tricks". 

October 1st 2009, 30 years after the release of their first album, a new Picture studio album “Old Dogs New Tricks” is officially released. The album contains a wide variety of hard rock and old school metal songs, completed with a breath taking ballad. The album was produced by Nico Verrips, who already produced and wrote numerous hits into the charts and who kept the eighties feeling, but gave the record a contemporary modern sound. 

Old Dogs New Tricks is a typical Picture album with a variety of heavy and dynamic songs. The powerful and raw voice of Pete Lovell shows to its full advantage with this kind of heavy music. Add the brilliantly composed songs anno 2009 to this and you will agree that this is Picture in their historically best line-up ever. This is Picture 2009! Be prepared to be blown away…]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Originally the band was a trio of Tim Eiermann, Joe Proell and Pit Muley, called Immortal Hate. They did a four track demo in 1990 called "Pyoginesis on a Festered Corpse". Some of the members were also in the Death/Grind band G.U.T. 

Starting with "Twinaleblood" Pyogenesis departed from metal and began playing alternative hard rock/punk rock.

Tim and Wolle had later on success with the alternative rock band Liquido.

After a long period of inactivity, the band announced an anniversery comeback in 2014.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Queensrÿche first burst onto the music scene in 1982 with the release of their self-titled 4 song EP Queensrÿche. They very quickly gained international recognition and performed to sold out audiences around the world. With the follow up first full length album "The Warning" in 1984, and the ground breaking 1986 release of "Rage For Order", Queensrÿche continued to prove their worldwide dominance as one of the most respected and creative bands of the 80's.

In 1988 the band turned out yet another monumental album"Operation:Mindcrime", which would go on to become one of the TOP 10 best selling concepts records of all time, and set the stage for continued sold out performances around the world. With the release of the critically acclaimed and commercially successful "Empire" in 1991, the band earned multiple Grammy Award nominations and won the MTV "viewers choice" award for the #1 chart topping hit "Silent Lucidity". During the next ten years, the band continued to release albums and tour the world to sold out audiences. Queensrÿche has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and have continued to break new ground and push their creative process.]]></description>

The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages including English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Rammstein's award-winning live shows are renowned for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and off-stage theatrics.

            <description><![CDATA[Русская зима ("Russkaja Zima") means "Russian Winter".

One of the very first Russian bands to incorporate black metal elements in their music. They're even believed to be one of the pioneers of black metal in Russia along with Преисподняя.

The band first split up in 1990, reformed in 1992, split up again in the beginning of 1995, and reformed again in 2012. There also existed a band of Pavel Leonov under the same name, renamed to Вечный Огонь in 2013. According to the band's official VKontakte page, those bands should not be mixed.

In 1990, a demo called OРЗ was recorded, but was lost.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Sabaton is a power metal band from Falun, Sweden formed in 1999. The band's main lyrical themes are based on war and historical battles. This is heard in the albums Primo Victoria, Attero Dominatus, Coat of Arms, Carolus Rex and Heroes, in which all of the songs contain these motifs, except final tracks which are tribute songs to influential heavy metal bands. Lyrical content drawn from World War I, World War II and other conflicts is prevalent and includes songs about battles and leaders on all sides of said conflicts.

In April 2012, guitarists Oskar Montelius and Rikard Sundén, drummer Daniel Mullback and keyboardist Daniel Mÿhr left the band to form Civil War. Vocalist Joakim Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström continued with new members. As well as extensively touring internationally, the band have a festival in their home town of Falun, Sabaton Open Air in August and an annual cruise, 'Sabaton Cruise', in November]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Savatage was born in the suburbs of Tampa, Florida in the early 1980's—the product of two brothers, Jon (vocals and keyboards) and Criss (guitar) Oliva, plus hard-hitting drummer Steve "Doc" Wacholz. Savatage quickly developed a loyal following throughout Florida, and in 1983, the band released its debut album, Sirens. The following year, Savatage signed to Atlantic records, and in 1985 they released their major-label debut, Power of the Night. Following the band's first significant tour, the lineup solidified with the addition of bassist Johnny Lee Middleton in late 1985.

The next few years of worldwide adventures included high points like 1987’s Hall of the Mountain King; the video for the title track saw heavy rotation on MTV’s Headbanger’s Ball, and the band—with the addition of second guitarist Chris Caffery—toured the world with the likes of Ted Nugent, Dio, and Megadeth. The success continued with 1989’s Gutter Ballet and the subsequent tour. By 1993, with the release of Edge of Thorns—the first record featuring new singer Zak Stevens—Savatage seemed poised to finally break big. But tragedy struck in the early-morning hours of October 17, 1993. Criss Oliva, the guitar player at the heart of Savatage, was driving home with his wife when a drunk driver slammed into their car head-on. Criss was killed instantly. 

Oliva's death was very nearly the end of Savatage as well. But the surviving members knew they had more music in them, and they knew that Criss, wherever he was, would want them to make it. After a brief US tour to support the cathartic Handful of Rain, the band recruited guitarist Al Pitrelli to join Caffery, as well as new drummer Jeff Plate, and returned to the studio to record Dead Winter Dead.

The penultimate track on Dead Winter Dead was "Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)"—an epic instrumental medley of the Christmas classics "Carol of the Bells" and "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," featuring a string orchestra alongside the electric guitars. "Christmas Eve" was an overnight sensation. 

Savatage producer Paul O'Neill knew he was on to something big. Savatage returned to the studio in the summer of 1996, this time with a full orchestra and a variety of singers. O’Neill intertwined a Christmas story with well-known classical pieces and the unique Savatage brand of rock and roll. This new project was christened Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and their first album, Christmas Eve and Other Stories—which included a re-release of "Christmas Eve"—was released in the fall of 1996. It has since sold more than 3 million copies, and its three followups have sold over 4 million more. The annual holiday tour consistently sells out venues across the United States and Canada. In 2008 alone, Trans-Siberian Orchestra played live for nearly 1.5 million people.

But Savatage itself did not go quietly into the night. Two more studio albums followed Dead Winter Dead, as did several US and international tours. And since the 2002 Poets & Madmen tour, the members of Savatage have embarked on a number of their own projects—in addition to their continued involvement with the fantastically popular Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Savatage members have formed several new bands and released a number of solo records.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The band has been around in one form or another since 1970 - first being known as Blue Condition, and then SOB, and finally Son of a Bitch, before being renamed to Saxon in 1977. This is not the same Blue Condition that Al Atkins (Judas Priest) sang for in the mid-1960s; that was a different band which split up in '68.

Former members Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson registered the name Saxon in 1997 behind the backs of the band, and for a period there were two versions of Saxon touring. On 25th February 2003, the law found in favour of Biff Byford, and Oliver and Dawson were forced to rename their version of the band Oliver/Dawson Saxon. 

In 2007, Saxon appeared in a Channel 4 (UK) documentary, where Harvey Goldsmith tries to "re-invent" them and help them have a hit single. The song in question was "If I Was You" (from "The Inner Sanctum" album), and Harvey produced an alternate version of the song than the one written by the band. Both versions were released on a single, which was also packaged in a noticeably different style than Saxon's other releases of the last 20 years. 

Later the same year, and during the Hard Rock Hell weekend festival in Minehead, UK, Nigel Glockler was attacked by 3 Inches of Blood drummer Alexei Rodriguez, who was as a result dismissed by his band. 

Biff Byford and Nibbs Carter have made guest appearances for Paul Di'Anno & Dennis Stratton; Byford, Carter, Nigel Glockler and Paul Quinn have all been featured for Air Pavilion.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Just when you think a genre has exhausted its possibilities, when a certain style of metal has hit the wall of mediocrity, along comes a band to jolt life back into it. Hailing from Sweden a mecca for melodic death metal and on a quest to pioneer their own form of that well-established genre, SCAR SYMMETRY proved to be an exceptional gathering of talents able to produce an eccentric mixture of metal that can only be described as an intoxicating, modern hybrid of melodic death metal. Encapsulating everything each band member loves about metal harmony, melody, brutality, exceptional songwriting, complex instrumentation - this union of Yin/Yang elements lent itself to SCAR SYMMETRYs blueprint of amalgamation in their quest to make unbridled music devoid of borders.

The bands name thought into existence by drummer Ohlsson denotes a peculiar balance. A combination of a hard word (scar), and a soft word (symmetry), it symbolizes the emotional scars everyone harvests from living a human life and the symmetry we share with each other as a result. For Jonas Kjellgren (Carnal Forge, Centinex, World Below), Henrik Ohlsson (Altered Aeon, Theory In Practice, Mutant), Per Nilsson (Altered Aeon), Christian lvestam (Unmoored, Incapacity, Torchbearer), and Kenneth Seil, the symmetry existed in spades. There was an instant click between these musicians hailing from different regions of Sweden, and difficult as it is to believe, the band sent the Stockholm-based Cold Records their one-track (!) demo, Seeds Of Rebellion, and landed a deal in mid-2004.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Scorpions began in 1964 as a beat band. Rudolf Schenker was also the vocalist in the beginning. Rudolf's younger brother Michael joined the band as lead guitarist in 1969 at the age of 15. Michael had been playing with Klaus Meine in the band Copernicus and both joined Scorpions at the same time.

After the release of the debut album in 1972 the younger Schenker was poached by the English hard rock band UFO and Scorpions split up.

Rudolph Schenker and Klaus Meine later went on join Uli Jon Roth's band Dawn Road, but the name was changed to Scorpions to capitalize on the recognition the name carried in the hard rock scene at the time.

Michael Schenker stayed with UFO from 1973 to 1978 before leaving as result of various feuds and alcohol problems. He briefly rejoined Scorpions and played on some parts of the Lovedrive album but similar problems to those he had with UFO led to his a quick departure. He then went on to form his own band called MSG - Michael Schenker Group (sometimes McAuley Schenker Group) - which is still active to this day.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The band name comes from a Portuguese translation of Motörhead's song "Dancing on Your Grave" which is "Dançando na sua Sepultura". Sepultura means "grave" (sepulchre) in Portuguese (and in some other Latin-based languages). Originally, they wanted to call the band Tropa de Choque (Shock Troops), but found that the name had been used before.

The first Sepultura show was on December 4th, 1984. The band played two songs that never were re-recorded or released.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Slayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California, formed in 1981 by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. Slayer rose to fame with its 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the "big four" thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Since its debut album in 1983, the band has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. 

Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song "Eyes of the Insane", and one in 2008 for the song "Final Six" (both from 2006's Christ Illusion). Slayer has also played at several music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest.

Slayer's musical style involves fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman, and lead vocalist/bassist Tom Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and most of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman, with additional help from Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo. 

The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism, and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits, and criticism from religious groups and the public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually, and lyrically. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4.9 million albums in the United States.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Heavy metal certainly has no shortage of rebels. It seems like everybody's rebelling against something, and that's part of the genre's allure. However, the most rebellious thing anybody can do is hold steadfast to personal beliefs and never waver. Stryper indisputably do both.
They're not shy about their Christian beliefs, but they're also consistently as heavy as any of the genre's pillars. Following up 2013's seminal opus No More Hell To Pay, which debuted at #6 on Billboard's Top Rock Albums Chart and #2 on the Christian Albums Chart, their eleventh full-length original album, Fallen [Frontiers Music SRL], is their heaviest offering to date.

"In the past 30 years, we've evolved into what we are now," says vocalist and guitarist Michael Sweet. "This is what we always really wanted to be. I love the progression. The story of Stryper is that of an underdog. We go against the grain with everything we do. This album is another chance to show the world what we can do."

In early 2015, Michael and his band mates Robert Sweet [drums], Oz Fox [guitar], and Tim Gaines [bass] retreated to Spirithouse Recording Studio in Northampton, MA. The four musicians collectively immersed themselves in the recording process for Fallen with Michael handling production yet again.

"There's something to be said for the chemistry of a whole band in the studio together," he continues. "We were there living and breathing this record, and I feel like the results speak for themselves."

Album opener "Yahweh" certainly does. Penned with Clint Lowery of Sevendust and Call Me No One, the six-minute plus anthem fuses tight thrash guitars with soaring vocals and a galloping beat. Airtight solos nearly collide with an orchestral refrain bolstered by a muscular groove.

"It's an epic unlike anything we've ever recorded," smiles Michael. "I was so moved by The Passion of the Christ. Even though it was bloody and disturbing, it represented what actually happened. I wanted the lyrics to be the same way."

At the same time, the first single "Pride" weaves together intricate fretwork with a slamming refrain that seesaws between swooning and searing. "Sometimes, pride gets in the way of what we want to accomplish or what we want to do," he sighs. "Everybody goes through that. It's my reminder saying, 'Let's not allow pride to tear us apart.' Nine times out of ten, that is what separates us. Beat our pride down, and we will survive."

"All Over Again" stands out as the album's centerpiece. With an orchestral elegance and an ever so slightly countrified swing, the track sits proudly in the Stryper canon alongside the likes of "Honestly." "It isn't a hair ballad or a piano ballad," he laughs. "It's different, and that's important to us. I have a funny feeling this might be a standout track for everyone."

Following a tradition of some bombastic and bruising covers, Stryper also tackled Black Sabbath's classic "After Forever." The foursome infused a new kind of fire into this timeless gem. "We grew up on Black Sabbath," he says. "It says something. Stryper covering a Sabbath tune causes much controversy. The lyrics are very interesting because it questions if Sabbath was a Christian band or not. They could have been the first Christian group if you take a closer look at those lyrics."

Stryper continue to remain metal stalwarts, leaving an indelible mark on the genre with every subsequent album. With hits in their arsenal such as "Calling On You", "Free", "I Believe In You" and "Always There For Your," album sales exceed over 10 million worldwide with their discography including one of the most successful Christian rock albums ever, 1986's multi-platinum, Grammy Award-nominate To Hell With The Devil. They also have the distinction of being the first band in history to notch two songs in MTV's Top 10 with "Free" and "Honestly."

Ultimately, for all the heaviness, Fallen possesses the power to uplift. What's more rebellious than that?

Michael leaves off, "I want everybody to walk away with excitement, encouragement, and joy. It's all positive. It's not about being heavy or dark. It's about sharing this energy. I hope they press the 'repeat' button and feel blown away."

That's exactly what all the best heavy metal does.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[A distinct murmur went around the world in 1994 when a certain six-string guitarist from New Jersey named Michael Romeo of the prog band Gemini recorded The Dark Chapter demo and sent it out to record labels. It seemed the new guitar messiah of the coming 21st Century had made himself known to the world and he’d soon launch a new band that would stir up the prog genre. With an innovative mixture of heavy metal, progressive rock and neo-classical sounds, Romeo and his men in SYMPHONY X recorded a debut album (released in Japan in ’94; released worldwide in 1995) that began their journey to create a blueprint for the young generation of prog metal bands to follow.

The Damnation Game (1995) celebrated the debut of the band‘s second asset: the charismatic, deeply emotional and relentlessly aggressive vocals of Russell Allen. The Divine Wings Of Tragedy (1997) placed the emphasis on the band’s progressive approach and is still considered to be SYMPHONY X’s ultimate masterpiece. Twilight In Olympus (1998) livened up the band’s classical aspects with the instrumental ‘Sonata’ (which is based on the piano Sonata No. 8 ‘Pathétique’ by Ludwig van Beethoven). Via V: The New Mythology Suite (2000), the quintet delivered their first concept album at the turn of the millenium that dealt with the myth of Atlantis. 

Live On The Edge Of Forever (2001) was visual proof that the band could easily transpose their complex material onto the stage. Oriented towards the eponymous poem by English poet John Milton, the thrashing harshness of The Odyssey (2002) is said to be the band’s most aggressive album to date. Paradise Lost (2007) is the darkest and most gothic-like work in the band’s discography.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Steve "Zetro" Souza from Exodus was the lead singer from 1985-1986, and he has done vocals for Testament at some points. There was precisely one show played as Legacy with Chuck Billy on vocals, in July 1986. 

Although still named Legacy at the time of recording, they couldn't relase the album under that name, as there was a jazz band who had registered it. Billy Milano suggested they name themselves Testament, and they liked it. They used their old name as the album title. 

Testament was one of the early thrash metal bands to sign to a major label, having signed to Atlantic in 1986.

Greg Christian had reportedly auditioned for bass or was asked to join Metallica following Cliff Burton's death. He was among the few who were considered for the role. 

In 2001, Chuck Billy was diagnosed with germ cell seminoma; a rare kind of cancer in Chuck's case because this is usually in the testicular region of a man's body, but Chuck had in his chest region near his heart. He had been undergoing numerous treatments and survived the cancer. Festivals and concerts had been held in helping raise money for Chuck's sickness. He has since been fully recovered.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In 2003, the year of the launch of TEXTURES’ debut album Polars, the first reactions start to stream in: “This is the best metal album that’s ever come out of the Netherlands” according to the Dutch music magazine Oor. The standard is set. TEXTURES, once just a promising up-and-coming band from the South of the Netherlands, has now emerged, 3 albums later, as an established name in the worldwide metal scene. 

The band’s fourth album Dualism -- on the band’s new home Nuclear Blast -- is groovier, catchier, and the production even grander than its 2008 predecessor Silhouettes. The band’s trademark mix of expertly crafted brutality, melody, freaky, innovative rhythms and catchy vocals is still intact, with Bart Hennephof and Jochem Jacobs’s expertly crafted sonic… um… textures and the unruly heavy-hitting of drummer Stef Broks creating the perfect metal cocktail. The climaxes of the songs on Dualism have been elevated to a higher level, partially due to the contribution of their new keyboard player, Uri Dijk and new frontman Daniel de Jongh (ex-Cilice) who, as far as his sound goes, is every bit the talent as his predecessor Eric Kalsbeek.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Twisted Sister is an American heavy metal band from Long Island, New York. Twisted Sister's most well-known hits include "We're Not Gonna Take It" and "I Wanna Rock". Many of the band's songs explore themes of parent vs. child conflicts and criticisms of the educational system.

Often considered glam metal for their image, the band rejects the "glam metal" label and considers it inappropriate. Twisted Sister are also ranked No. 73 in VH1's 100 greatest artists of hard rock. On March 20, 2015 Twisted Sister announced that A. J. Pero had died by issuing the following press release: "The members of Twisted Sister are profoundly saddened to announce the untimely passing of our brother, AJ Pero. The band, crew and most importantly the family of AJ Pero thank you for your thoughts and prayers at this time." Shortly thereafter, Adrenaline Mob, who also featured Pero on drums, released a statement revealing that Pero had died whilst sleeping on the band's tour bus.

On April 7, 2015, TMZ.com reported that Twisted Sister will embark on their final tour, dubbed "Forty and Fuck It", in 2016. Mike Portnoy (of The Winery Dogs and Transatlantic and formerly of Dream Theater and Adrenaline Mob) will be filling in for Pero on drums on this tour. The band has also announced tribute shows in honor of A.J. Pero. The first show is in Las Vegas, NV on May 30th at The Joint Hard Rock Hotel with Skid Row, Extreme, and Great White, which will also be filmed for broadcast, as well as for a CD and a DVD. The 2nd is being dubbed “Twisted Sister – A Concert to Honor AJ Pero". It will be held in Sayreville, NJ at the Starland Ballroom on June 13th.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Alone in an arid, desolate terrain - known to Earth Humans as Arizona, part of the United States Federation - a hominid-type creature named David DiSanto felt a growing shift in his consciousness. He was seeking something, something he could not find... a break from the mediocrity of the stagnant heavy metal landscape. This need began to consume him - searching through endless record bins and compilations, desperately seeking the type of sounds that resonated from within his cranial cavity. All was in vain. The repetition began to eat at his mind.

Faced with the mundane, he chose to reject the ways of feeble earth minds, and realized his mission - to cease his search, and create a new voice within heavy metal. VEKTOR was born.

It was Earth Year 2002, of the Common Era. 

The early years were bleak. David was alone. But, this did not deter him. He began writing songs and composed demos. He enlisted the help of a drummer, Willy Redshaw, to provide percussion on these early efforts. The first demo, "Nucleus", was self-released in 2003. 

Soon, a new handful of brave earth beings joined him in the pursuit of his mission. They brought their unique skills and individual views. As time wore on, most these brave men were moved to other missions. 

During this period of change, two more demos were released: "Demolition" in 2006, and "Hunger for Violence" in 2007.

Through the dust, however, three individuals shone through as true cosmonauts crucial to the next phase of the mission. These men were Erik Nelson, Blake Anderson, and Frank Chin.

Together, they recorded Vektor's first full-length album, "Black Future", which was released in 2009 on Heavy Artillery Records.

Ever forging ahead, Vektor's second full-lenght album, "Outer Isolation", was released in 2011 on Heavy Artillery Records. Following the collapse of Heavy Artillery (the Lizard Master Race has not been ruled out as suspects in this incident...) Earache Records swiftly added Vektor to their list of mercenaries. "Outer Isolation" was then re-released in 2013.

Once the decimation of the western coast of the United States was complete, VEKTOR decided to shift their HQ to a more densely populated area. After all, what better way to spread the disease? This decision found the band in their new home of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are now in striking distance of metropolitan areas such as New York City and Washington DC, as well as more strategic access to the unconquered fronts of Western Europe...

As of this writing, in the eighth month of Earth Year 2015 CE, VEKTOR is verging on the horizon of another release of meteoric proportions. Their third full-length album, "Terminal Redux", is slated for release later this year. 

VEKTOR has shared the stage with countless acts within, and across, the metal world. They have gone on several full US headlining tours and enjoyed several segmented North American tours with acts such as Municipal Waste, Napalm Death, EYEHATEGOD, and Exhumed. They shared a Main Stage at HellFest in France (an experience shared with veteran acts such as VOIVOD, Testament, KISS, Twisted Sister, Down, and many others), and, on the other side of the world, VEKTOR played two nights of Japanese Assault Fest in Tokyo alongside the legendary Girlschool.]]></description>

It all started way back in the 70's in the north of England, a young Heavy Metal / Punk Rocker called Conrad Lant [aka: Cronos] started working in a recording studio [Impulse Studios] as the assistant engineer after leaving school, he had been interested in music from an early age and had played in a few different bands throughout his school days, with the idea of creating a band that was heavier and more over the top than anything anyone had ever seen or heard before, more Satanic than Black Sabbath, louder than Motörhead, with a pyrotechnic show to rival Kiss, and with even more leather and studs than Judas Priest, the ultimate ingredients for the Ultimate Metal Band.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Anomaly. Seminal. Iconoclasts. A "band's band". These are the nebulous words that sum up a group of artists now in their third decade of collaboration and creation. These terms are yokes that Voivod must bear. Yet there is a purity in this fate that will live forever.

What were the odds in the first place? Four young men in Quebec, addled by art, high on hash, fueled by Venom and Motorhead. Post-heavy metal, pre-MTV. The 80s were upon them and the threat of nuclear war seemed almost inevitable. Why not live out the endtimes sipping absinthe, writing music, and donning leather and spikes?

Michel Langevin conceived a universe, a character, an anti-hero; The Voivod. Dressed in fanciful garb woven by Bram Stoker and Stanley Kubrick, the Voivod was a vampire lord in a post-nuclear age. Immortal and unstoppable. The ultimate goal of any artist. Michel chose to take on the powers of his creation by breathing life into the Voivod's universe. By creating a musical vehicle for the Voivod's saga. By starting a garage band.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal or rock, although the "gothic" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album Enter, was mostly gothic metal. Enter even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that "we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band".]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Before Mötley Crüe, before RATT, even before there was a Metallica, Y&T was slogging away in sweaty rock clubs around America. When the band formed in the early 1970s, little did they know they would set the standard for hard rock bands that trailed. Many of the biggest acts of the ’80s became popular opening for headliners Y&T—and cut their teeth on the band, as evidenced by the Y&T mentions in tell-all books by acts such as Metallica and Mötley Crüe.

Born in Oakland, California, Y&T is one of the San Francisco Bay Area’s own innovators of the hard rock sound. Whether performing to a festival crowd of fifty-thousand or in an intimate nightclub, Y&T’s high-energy set and passionate performances still captivate legions of fans around the globe, proving Y&T’s music timeless.

Originally formed as Yesterday and Today, the initial powerhouse quartet—featuring Dave Meniketti (lead guitar/lead vocals), Phil Kennemore (bass), Leonard Haze (drums), and Joey Alves (rhythm guitar)—tore through the ’70s and ’80s with their own brand of hard rock. After two ’70s albums on London Records, they shortened their name to Y&T and released eight albums on A&M in the ’80s. Two more albums with Geffen Records marked an era of change with Jimmy DeGrasso (Alice Cooper, Suicidal Tendencies, Megadeth) on drums and Stef Burns (Alice Cooper, Berlin, Huey Lewis) on guitar.

With a discography of 18 albums, three greatest hits collections, plus a boxed set, Y&T has sold over four million albums since their 1974 inception. The band’s most recent single I’m Coming Home has climbed to roughly 1.5 million views on YouTube. Y&T received extensive airplay with hits such as Forever, Rescue Me, Mean Streak, Don’t Stop Runnin’, and Summertime Girls—which played in heavy rotation on MTV. Y&T songs have been featured in a multitude of movies and television shows, including Real Genius, Out of Bounds, Baywatch, and Hunter. After five top 100 albums, songs that tipped into the 40s, two Bammie Awards, and many international television appearances, Y&T’s hits are still played on VH1 Classic and classic rock radio stations worldwide.

With Kennemore’s untimely passing from lung cancer, the band carries on the legacy that is Y&T. Y&T continues to tour the world, featuring Dave Meniketti (guitar/lead vocals), John Nymann (guitar/vocals), Brad Lang (bass/vocals), and Mike Vanderhule (drums/vocals), playing songs that span the band’s five-decade career and including all the hits and fan favorites. Prepare to have your face melted.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Yngwie Malmsteen was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on June 30, 1963. The youngest child in a household that included his mother Rigmor, sister Ann Louise, and brother Bjorn, Yngwie originally had no interest in music. However, on September 18, 1970, Yngwie saw a TV special on the death of guitar iconoclast Jimi Hendrix. Seven-year-old Yngwie watched with awe as Hendrix blasted the audience with torrents of feedback and sacrificed his guitar in flames. The day Jimi Hendrix died, the guitar-playing Yngwie was born.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Fists raised in the air. Bodies, heavily perspiring, crush against each other and threaten to burst through steel barricades. Security forces gaze forward with a mix of aggression, tension and fear. Monstrous decibels pound each and every human in the chest, relentless, overpowering, captivating. Is this some club consumed by fiercely “kvlt” dystopian noise? A festival tent, throbbing with oppressively jagged electronic grooves? Are there headbangers hoisting cups of beer, or Millennials enthralled in rapturous joy? It’s none of it, yet all of it. It’s Skrillex meets Slayer. It’s a singular entity. It’s ZARDONIC.

Zardonic is as much as “band” as it is a concept, an idea, a perfect flashpoint and balance between divergent styles joined together through a prism of aggression, atmosphere and absolute immersion. Zardonic is a symbol, an icon, a mask; increasingly as ubiquitous in the international hard EDM and heavy metal underground as the mask worn by Deadmau5. Zardonic is also a person. Venezuelan born Federico Augusto Ágreda Álvarez is a multi-instrumentalist, DJ, composer and mixer, whose fingerprints dirtied remixes from Australian speedcore merchants The Berzerker, long-running Norwegian black metal titans Gorgoroth and massive standard bearers Nine Inch Nails.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Adele Laurie Blue Adkins (born 5 May 1988) is an English singer and songwriter. Graduating from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006, Adele was given a recording contract by XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace the same year. In 2007, she received the Brit Awards "Critics' Choice" award and won the BBC Sound of 2008 poll. 

Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times platinum in the UK, and double platinum in the US. An appearance she made on Saturday Night Live in late 2008 boosted her career in the US.

            <description><![CDATA[Chef’Special has built a loyal following in the Netherlands over the past five years and is winning hearts internationally as they are crossing the borders of Belgium, Germany and Switserland. Renowned for their energetic and dynamic live show Chef’Special played an extensive amount of shows at highly acclaimed festivals such as Pinkpop, Lowlands, Sziget and Cape Town International Jazz. With an overall sound that is often compared to Fun Lovin’ Criminals, G. Love and Red Hot Chili Peppers, this five-piece band boasts a solid set of catchy funk, Hiphop, rock and reggae tunes offset by beautiful lyrics and the occasional big orchestral gesture. 

Their debut album, One For The Mrs. (dedicated to their band bus), was released in March 2011. Singles Birds’, ‘Scribblin’ and ‘My Night Off’ have found particle favour with fans, with the latter becoming something of an anthem.

Their music and accessible persona have seen them chosen as 3FM Serious Talent (national radio station) and resident band for Holland’s most popular TV show, De Wereld Draait Door. Nominations for four 3FM Awards and MTV Award ‘Best Dutch Band’ confirms they’re on the road to success. Chef’Special just got back from Brooklyn, NYC where they recorded their second album with The Lion’s Share. The album will be presented at Paradiso, Amsterdam on the 7th of February 2014.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Claire Elise Boucher (born March 17, 1988), better known by the stage name Grimes, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, music video director, and record producer. Born and raised in Vancouver, she first became involved with the underground music scene and began recording her own experimental music while attending McGill University in Montréal. Boucher released the studio albums Geidi Primes and Halfaxa through Arbutus Records in 2010, and signed a secondary recording contract with 4AD in 2011. 

Her third studio album Visions (2012) and its singles "Genesis" and "Oblivion" received widespread critical acclaim; it was hailed as "one of the most impressive albums of the year so far" by The New York Times, was nominated for the Polaris Prize, and received the Juno Award for Electronic Album of the Year. Her fourth studio album Art Angels was released in 2015 and has since become her highest-charting project in the United States peaking at number 36.

Grimes' music has been noted by critics and journalists for its atypical combination of vocal elements, as well as a wide array of influences, ranging from electronica to pop, hip hop, R&B and even medieval music. In 2013 Grimes was awarded the Webby Award for Artist of the Year]]></description>

Under the Har Mar moniker, Sean has gone through a plethora of phases, ranging from fun-loving, beats-based music pioneer (he and Peaches shared stages early on) to angry arena crowd opener (a 2002 public lewdness allegation proves it) to soul music crooner. His last album Bye Bye 17 opened a lot of people’s minds to his songwriting prowess, which has existed since day one of his career. 

For years, Tillmann was an artist’s artist when The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Gossip, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and many other legends decided to collaborate and/or take him on tour. Different phases of his career brought him fame through the fickle worlds of indie, British pop, LA DJ-dom, and New York night crawling.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Jake Bugg (born Jake Edwin Kennedy Bugg, 28 February 1994) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter. His self-titled debut album, some of which was co-written with songwriter Iain Archer, was released in October 2012 and reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. His second album, Shangri La, was released in November 2013. His main influences are Don McLean, Donovan, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, and the Everly Brothers. In an interview with Absolute Radio in 2014 he also mentioned that the American heavy metal band Metallica was a huge influence to him when he first picked up the guitar as a 12-year-old.

Jake Bugg was born in Clifton, Nottingham, to musical parents who separated when he was young. His father, whose last name was Bugg, was a nurse, and his mother worked in sales, both having previously made recordings. He grew up in the Clifton council estate of Nottingham and started playing guitar at the age of 12 after being introduced to the instrument by his uncle Mark. He attended Farnborough school technology college in Clifton. He also states that his formative musical moment was hearing Don McLean's "Vincent (Starry, Starry Night)" on an episode of The Simpsons. He was enrolled in a music technology course, but by the age of 16 he had dropped out and was writing and performing his own songs influenced by the Beatles, Johnny Cash, Don McLean, Donovan, the Everly Brothers and Jimi Hendrix.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Over the last few years Belgian artist Milow has emerged as one of Europe’s most exciting young talents: a plugged-in singer-songwriter with the ability to touch a crowd and the pop know-how required to make great records. He’s an old-school soul with a new-fashioned sensibility. Milow’s music gleams with the inherited song craft of his heroes but it also reflects a point of view all his own. For many artists, success means stop; for Milow, who has sold more than a million albums in Europe, it’s a reason to go. 

After five years of non-stop touring and having released several well-received albums, Milow moved to Southern California in 2012. Not to start conquering the US, but to recharge his batteries in a sun-drenched region where he had lived before. With the same humble spirit that originally inspired him to start writing songs as a teenager, he patiently worked on his next move in seclusion in a city where no one knew him.

The result of this two-year journey is reflected on the folky new album "Silver Linings”. Milow reveals himself as a mature artistic personality and shows a much more melancholic side. The ten songs on "Silver Linings" captivate the listener with the irresistible hooks that the charismatic musician was so loved for on his earlier albums, and draw the listener in. The album was recorded live in Los Angeles at Fairfax Recordings, the studio known in music history as Sound City Studios; great albums by Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Neil Young and Nirvana were created here. Together with his producer of many years Jo Francken (who was at the helm for both Milow’s European debut “Milow" and "North and South") and Kevin Augunas (known for his work for Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, The Lumineers, Cold War Kids and Valerie June), Milow surrounded himself with an illustrious team: Clif Norrell (Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M., Tom Petty) was at the mixing desk, Larry Goldings (James Taylor, Norah Jones, Maceo Parker) was on keyboards and Matt Chamberlain (Fiona Apple, David Bowie, Kanye West) on drums. 

Guitars were provided by Val McCullum (Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson) and Tom Vanstiphout (a member of Milow's band since 2007). The album features a 13-piece live string section, as well as additional guests like Roger Manning Jr. (Beck), Greg Leisz (Ray LaMontagne, Eric Clapton) and introduces Courtney Marie Andrews, a 23-year-old singer-songwriter from Seattle who has already released four solo albums, providing backing vocals.

The combination of the intimate and the widescreen has won Milow a devoted fanbase across Europe, not to mention a list of achievements that includes hit singles, platinum albums, sold-out tours, performances at some of the world’s most prestigious festivals and millions upon millions of YouTube hits. What’s more, he’s accomplished all this as his own boss, releasing music through Homerun Records, a label he founded in 2005 in his bedroom. 

“I just never wanted to have to answer to anyone else,” he says of the DIY operation. “It’s always been my call.” A sophisticated music-scene veteran with the bottomless energy of a beginner, Milow’s ready for what’s next.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Roos-Anne (Sanne) Hans better known by her stage name Miss Montreal (born 22 September 1984 in Dedemsvaart), is a Dutch singer-songwriter and guitar player. In her live shows she was accompanied by her band made up of Kobus Groen (bass, backing vocals), Michi Schwiemann (guitar), Thijs Rensink (drums) and Peter Hendriks (keyboards). Sanne Hans first was part of the formation Ysis made up of her on vocals and guitar, Inge van Calkar also on guitar and vocals and Ilse Gerritsen on the cello. They all had stuttering problems in their speeches, without that deterring their singing.

After Ysis disbanded in 2008, she did advertising features and appeared on various radio and television shows. She also sang "Dansen aan zee" with Dutch band BLØF and "I Am Sorry" with Dutch band Only Seven Left.
October 2008 saw her first solo single "Just a Flirt" followed by a debut album the self-titled Miss Montreal in May 2009 releasing "This is my life" as a second single. She appeared in a number of festivals including in Lowlands, Parkpop, Beatstad and Zwarte Cross and opened for Coldplay at the Goffertpark in front of 70,000 spectators. She sang "Won't You Let Me Have My Way with You" featuring Bertolf Lentink in a joint EP released in 2009 by the two artists.

Her second album So... Anything Else came in July 2010 with a grand tour of 20 Dutch cities to promote the album. The tour continued until April 2011. She also became famous by singing the intro to the children TV program Huisje, Boompje, Beestje. Her third album I Am a Hunter was released on 13 April 2012, engaging on another long tour called "S-SS-SSS-Sanne" stretching until March 2013.

In 2012, Sanne appeared as a member of the jury of the television series De beste singer-songwriter van Nederland, and she is currently a coach on the sixth season of The Voice of Holland.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Kooks are a British rock band formed in Brighton, East Sussex, in 2004. The band currently consists of Luke Pritchard (vocals/guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar/synth), Alexis Nunez (drums), and Peter Denton (bass guitar). The original bassist was Max Rafferty. The lineup of the band remained constant until the departure of Rafferty in 2008. Dan Logan served as a temporary replacement, until Peter Denton joined the band permanently in October 2008. Early in 2010, Pritchard announced the departure of drummer Paul Garred, due to a nerve problem in his arm. 

Late in the year, Garred rejoined for studio sessions, however Chris Prendergast played drums when the band played live. In 2012, the band was accompanied on drums by Alexis Nunez (from Golden Silvers), who eventually joined the band full-time. A self-described "pop" band, their music is primarily influenced by the 1960s British Invasion movement and post-punk revival of the new millennium. With songs described as "catchy as hell", The Kooks have experimented in several genres including rock, Britpop, pop, reggae, ska, and more recently, funk and hip-hop, being described once as a "more energetic Thrills or a looser Sam Roberts Band, maybe even a less severe Arctic Monkeys at times".

Signed to Virgin Records just three months after forming, The Kooks broke into the musical mainstream with their debut album Inside In/Inside Out (2006). The album was ultimately successful, achieving quadruple platinum status in the UK within a year and also overseas in the form of a platinum certification in Australia and two times platinum in Ireland. The Kooks found themselves entering into mainstream media attention, with the band winning the award for Best UK & Ireland Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006 and picking up a nomination at The Brit Awards for the single "She Moves in Her Own Way". 

With their follow-up Konk (2008) debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, it recorded first week sales of 65,000, achieving gold status in both the UK and Ireland. Their third studio album, entitled Junk of the Heart, was released on 12 September 2011. Their most recent album Listen was released on 8 September 2014 and debuted at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart.]]></description>

In the week following the crash, their then-current single "Boys That Sing" entered the UK Singles Chart at number 80 and their previous single "Swings and Waterslides" entered at number 11, following a public campaign to boost sales. In the same week, "Swings and Waterslides" also entered at number 3 on the sales-only chart (which excludes streaming data) and "Boys That Sing" entered at number 27 on the same chart]]></description>

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut studio album titled OnlySee on Flavoured Records in Australia. Following the event, she moved to London, England and provided lead vocals for British duo Zero 7.

In 2000, Sia signed to Sony Music's sub-label Dance Pool and released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, the following year. Displeased with the promotion of the record, she signed to Go! Beat and released her third studio album, Colour the Small One, in 2004. Dissatisfied with the project's struggling to connect with a mainstream audience, Sia relocated to New York City in 2005 and began touring across the United States. 

Sia released her fourth and fifth studio releases, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, in 2008 and 2010, respectively. In 2014, Sia released her sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear, which was preceded by the top-ten single "Chandelier". On 29 January 2016, she released her seventh studio album This Is Acting. Sia's music incorporates hip hop, funk and soul as a base for her vocal styling. 

In 2014, she was ranked the 97th richest Australian person under the age of 40 by BRW magazine, with a reported net worth of AU$20 million. Her music has received an array of accolades, including ARIA Awards and MTV Music Awards.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Sometimes, you can feel where a band is from. Agent Fresco are as untamed, graceful, momentous, dangerous and unpredictable as the land they come from. Agent Fresco are from Iceland – a country almost impossible not to be influenced by. “Living in a country that has summers of non-stop light and winters of almost complete darkness is bound to have an impact on your state of mind,” says vocalist, composer and frontman Arnór Dan Arnarson. So that’s settled.

Agent Fresco’s music is a reflection of this ever-changing landscape, with its overwhelming sense of freedom and vastness. This is a progressive Art Rock band that needs to be experienced from a few steps back to be grasped in its entirety, like a bold work of art. In the last couple of years, their iridescent, propulsive, arty and highly addictive music made the highly esteemed Reykjavik band – comprised of Arnór Dan, Þórarinn Guðnason, Hrafnkell Örn Guðjónsson and Vignir Rafn Hilmarsson – become the favourite of a music-loving nation and an act sparking international interest. 

Or, to use the words of MTV’s own Halley Bondy: “By and large one of the best bands to come out of Iceland”. And this in a country with a higher band per capita ratio than most others!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[From humble beginnings in a rural French Canadian home town, Céline Dion has risen to international superstardom like a shooting star. Céline has been called the premier contemporary pop vocalist of the Nineties. She has earned music industry accolades from around the world: Grammy Awards in the US, Juno and Felix Awards in Canada, and World Music Awards in Europe. The entire world has seen Céline Dion literally transform herself from a gifted pre-adolescent into an international superstar.

Born in Charlemagne (a small town 30 miles east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada), Céline is the youngest of 14 children of a highly musical family. Her parents, both musicians, operated a small club, and on weekends, the entire family performed and entertained the local population. From the tender age of 5, Céline sang with her siblings and quickly acquired the ability to perform live. At the age of twelve, together with her mother and one of her brothers, Céline composed a French song which would forever alter the course of her life.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[If there’s been one constant in NOFX’s twenty-five year career, it’s been their quest to innovate, whether that means writing the world’s most prolific punk song (“The Decline”), playing shows in some of the most dangerous locales in the world (as evidenced in their Fuse TV series Backstage Passport) or tackling subject matter that will make you laugh, cry and critically think—often within the confines of the same song. NOFX (frontman Fat Mike, drummer Erik Sandin and guitarists Eric Melvin and El Hefe) carry on this tradition with their eleventh studio album Coaster, which exposes a more personal and introspective side of one’s of punk’s most revered and enigmatic acts.

“I think that this record is more old-school than anything we’ve done in the past,” Mike says about Coaster. “NOFX were a hardcore band that got melodic, but to me the best kind of music came out of that early ’80s L.A. movement,” he continues, citing acts like the Adolescents and Circle Jerks as constant influences and adding that Coaster is “a little darker and less aggressive than our other stuff.” Recorded with legendary Descendents drummer Bill Stevenson at San Francisco’s Motor Studios, the album accurately captures the eighties sound—although Mike insists this wasn’t a conscious effort. “We’d just start playing a song and we all kept thinking that clean guitar tones would sound better; it just kind of drove it more,” he explains, adding that the band strictly used vintage Silvertone amps and Fender Jazzmasters to capture that era’s incendiary sound.

When you consider what Mike has been through since the band released Wolves In Wolves’ Clothing in 2006, it shouldn’t any surprise that some of Coaster’s lyrical content is bleak—a fact that’s evidenced on the band’s most personal song to date, “My Orphan Year,” which is about the passing of both of his parents in 2006. “Once I had a kid I realized that you have to give your child a lot of attention if you want to be a parent, so when my dad asked me to come see him on his death bed I just said no, where were you when I was a kid” he explains when asked about the song’s content. “Alternately, I was with my mom for the whole month that she died 24 hours a day,” he continues, adding that many people have cried the first time they’ve heard the track. “I know a lot of people who have had similar experiences, so it’s really amazing to be able to evoke that kind of emotion from people.”

However that doesn’t mean that Coaster is a complete downer—and from awkward conversations with lesbian sisters (“Creeping Out Sara”) to a critical view of domestic exceptionalism (“We Called It America”) and the skewering of organized religion (“The Best God In Show”), Coaster is still teeming when the razor-sharp wit and parody that NOFX have become famous for. “People are like, ‘Why don’t you stop bashing these Christians already?’” Mike explains, when asked about Coaster’s subject matter. “It’s because I can’t get away from it. From the daily news to religious wars to Proposition 8 and the fucking gullibility of people thinking there’s some guy who’s the son of God,” he continues with a sigh. “I can’t believe how stupid people are, yet these same people are running the fucking world.”

While the world may not be a perfect place, NOFX have always made the best of it, which is evidenced in their successful TV series that aired last year on Fuse TV. “Backstage Passport wasn’t like ‘Let’s do a TV show,’ it was like, ‘Let’s show people how much fun we have on tour because we don’t know any other band that does,’” Mike explains. “It isn’t showing four guys just bitching about how hard it is to be on the road and how they miss their family, but about how much fun we’re having in crazy situations,” he continues. “We tour with a lot of bands and it always seems like we’re having the best time of our lives, no matter what goes wrong or right at the gigs.”

After famously refusing to make videos and give interviews for a majority of their career, both Backstage Passport and Coaster are insightful glimpses into the inner workings of one of punk’s most iconic and guarded bands—and whether you’re new to NOFX or have followed their rise to unlikely cult superstardom over the past two decades, these releases also show that punk’s most irresponsible band can actually mature.sort of. “I wrote a song about my parents dying and then I cry in Israel on TV,” Mike summarizes when asked to condense the past few years into one sentence. “I think this year you definitely get to see the inside of NOFX instead of the goofy exterior,” Mike acknowledges,“and people seem to enjoy it.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[If you think you know Pennywise, think again. Though the band has made a name for themselves over the past 26 years as a politically minded, melodic hardcore act who have sold millions of albums. They have become one of the most successful independent acts of all time, however they weren't always this way. In fact the group got their start playing backyard parties in their hometown of Hermosa Beach, California, without having any aspirations other than playing as many songs as they could before the police showed up. This side of the band has never been captured until now and Yesterdays sees the band putting some of their nascent material in proper recorded form for the first time ever. 

Not only is this the perfect way to welcome the band's original vocalist Jim Lindberg back into the fold but Yesterdays is also in many way’s a homage to Pennywise's original bassist Jason Thirsk who wrote a bulk of the lyrics and music to these songs in the late 80s (Thirsk subsequently passed away in 1996). "Jason was the emotional core of Pennywise and his songwriting was very much about PMA (positive mental attitude) and that's really what initially drew me to the band and where we started out," Lindberg explains. “The punk scene had became really cynical and confused in the late eighties and it seemed like the only bands that were doing anything inspiring were the one's singing about positivity and unity and heading in a new direction." 

Lindberg refers to Yesterdays as a "new album of old songs. It's an accurate description when you consider that the band had to relearn many of the songs here from a cassette they recorded at their rehearsal space back in 1988. Original recordings of these can be heard at the end of the album. The remaining material consists of outtakes written during Pennywise's Full Circle and Straight Ahead era during the late nineties. However when Lindberg, guitarist Fletcher Dragge, drummer Byron McMackin and bassist Randy Bradbury recut these songs earlier this year they inevitably made them sound as urgent and as they did when they were originally written. 

"We always wanted to go back and record these songs because later in our career we started to get more political and angry— that may have turned some people off but that's what we were feeling at the time," Lindberg explains. "In the back of our minds we knew we had these cool, old songs that were more life-affirming, it just took us 25 years to get back to it." Recorded in the band's hometown factory district which is known for its influx of rehearsal studios and surfboard repair shops, Pennywise were conscious give the tracks a hometown feel and preserve their original spirit. “We tracked the whole thing in a few days doing a couple of takes of each song so it's a really raw album in that sense."

From the anthemic sing-along "What You Deserve" to the Minor Threat-inspired "Noise Pollution" and midtempo melodicism of "She's A Winner" (which was written as an homage to Thirsk's girlfriend at the time), it is clear why these songs got Pennywise signed to Epitaph. Even the most hardcore fans of the act will hear another side of Pennywise here. It's the perfect collection of songs to bring the band back together following two sold out shows welcoming Lindberg back at the Los Angeles Palladium in 2012. "Instead of having the pressure to write a new album it made more sense for us to play these songs and remember why we started Pennywise in the first place and I think that helped us out a lot," the vocalist explains.

The songs on Yesterdays mirror this sentiment, particularly tracks like "Thanksgiving" which memorably features the line, "think about all you have, not about what you can't get." "It's a keystone song for the band in that it’s simple message but it's important for people who are going through a tough time and feeling beaten down to hear, and that's what bands like Dag Nasty and 7 Seconds did for us with their music," Lindberg explains. "They wrote songs that felt like someone encouraging you to keep your head up and I think that type of message lies at the core of the songs on Yesterdays and embody the type of music that we've always aspired to create," he adds.

"Losing Jason was a terrible tragedy for all of us and he was such a big part of the Pennywise spirit, so us going back and recording these songs was a huge inspiration because it reminded of us of where we were when we started and why people responded to the band in such a powerful way," Lindberg summarizes. "These songs are Pennywise in our purest form and it's really as much of a gift to us as it is to our fans, many of whom have been waiting for real recordings of these tracks for years. It marks a new chapter for the band while still staying true to the way we started twenty six years ago."]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Suicidal Tendencies (also known as S.T. or simply Suicidal) is an American crossover thrash band founded in 1981 in Venice, California by vocalist Mike Muir, who is the only remaining original member of the band. The band is often credited (along with D.R.I.) as one of "the fathers of crossover thrash". To date, Suicidal Tendencies have released nine studio albums, one EP, four split albums including the rare Welcome to Venice, six compilation albums (one of which is a "double-EP", while the other is a re-recording of their debut album), and two long-form videos.

Suicidal Tendencies rose to fame with their 1983 self-titled debut album, which spawned the single "Institutionalized", and was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. Suicidal Tendencies' next release was on their own label, Suicidal Records, where they contributed one song, "Look Up...(The Boys Are Back)", on the 1985 split Welcome to Venice. After releasing their second album Join the Army (1987), 

Suicidal Tendencies were signed to Epic Records in 1988, and continued their success with their next three albums, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988), Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Déjà Vu (1989) and Lights... Camera... Revolution! (1990); the latter of the two were certified Gold by the RIAA. Their 1992 follow-up album The Art of Rebellion was also very successful, and included two of their biggest hits "Nobody Hears" and "I'll Hate You Better".

After releasing two more studio albums (Still Cyco After All These Years and Suicidal for Life), the band broke up and severed ties from Sony and Epic in 1995. However, they reunited a year later and have continued to perform and record since then. After over a decade of work and many lineup changes, Suicidal Tendencies released their eleventh studio album with all-new material, 13, in 2013. The band has been in talks of releasing a follow-up album in the future]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Heavy are the music industry’s worst kept secret. They make blazing, urgent, infectious rock-soul with a strong dose of hip-hop. You’ve heard their songs in a lot of different places, and it’s likely that you loved them.

Forming in the fertile swamps of England’s West Country in the mid-naughties, around the axis of Dan Taylor (guitarist and songwriter) and Kelvin Swaby (vocalist and songwriter,) the Heavy immediately astounded. Jaw dropping, freshly minted riffs, swinging hip-hop drums, funk-ridden bass and Swaby’s startling, Mayfield-esque vocals meant early singles ‘That Kind of Man’ and ‘Colleen’ blew minds and won hearts. The debut album they were taken from – ‘Great Vengeance and Furious Fire’ – became an instant connoisseurs’ classic.

It was their sophomore album, though, that saw them blasting into homes across the globe. ‘The House that Dirt Built’ was everything a second album should be: a deeper, richer progression from the band’s early work. It also yielded the mighty ‘How You Like Me Now?’ The single was licensed for a major commercial in the 3rd Quarter of the Superbowl (the biggest ad slot in the world) and quite simply went stratospheric.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[It was an old jones for biochemistry that lured Milo away from the band. In 1987 he hung up his microphone cord to pursue further education. But much questing was left to do in pursuit of ALL-ness; they'd come too far to turn back. With Milo's departure came a sort of rebirth. Bill, Karl, and Stephen re-christened their entity under a new name, enlisting a new vocalist and renewing the eternal crusade. The only name that fit, of course, was ALL. Thus an alter-ego was created. The live albums, "Liveage" and "Hallraker," would stand as the Descendents' definitive and culminated sound, while ALL blazed onward, releasing eight amazing (and still self-produced) albums between 1988 and 1995. 

Fronted by singer Chad Price, the ALL touring machine left no continent uninvaded, spreading the tenets of ALL and at the same time introducing new kids to the Descendents legacy. The legend still grew and people were buying more ALL and Descendents records than ever. On an undisclosed date in 1996, deemed by some as Science's Finest Hour, Milo hung up his lab coat and the Descendents began work on a new LP. Produced by Bill and Stephen at the band's own studio in Ft. Collins, CO (aptly dubbed The Blasting Room), "Everything Sucks" picks up EXACTLY where the Descendents left off. The tracks "Everything Sucks," "This Place," and "Coffee Mug" are classic Descendents, raging along at the speed of sound, while "I'm the One", "Sick-O-Me," and "She Loves Me" are anthems of the "girl-song" milieu. All new material, all original members. Milo and the boys sound stronger than ever.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Discharge is a British hardcore punk band formed in 1977 by Terry "Tezz" Roberts and Roy "Rainy" Wainwright. They are often considered among one of the very first bands to play hardcore punk. While the band had substantial lineup changes over its history, the core members over the early 1980s, when the band produced its key recordings, were Kelvin "Cal" Morris (vocals), Tony "Bones" Roberts (guitar), Roy Wainwright (bass), and Terry Roberts (drums).

The band's music is characterized by a heavy, distorted, and grinding guitar-driven sound and rawly shouted vocals, with lyrics on anarchist and pacifist themes. The band's first album in 1982, Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing, went to number two on the UK Indie charts and number 40 in the UK Album Chart. In the early 1980s, the group had a number of singles and EPs place in the top 10 of the UK indie charts, including the 1981 EP Why(#1) and the 1982 single State Violence State Control.

After 1982, the addition of guitarist Peter "Pooch" Purtill brought significant thrash metal crossover elements to the band. In the 1990s, the band released several metal-influenced albums, which alienated some of the original fan base. In the early 2000s, the original line up was reunited and they released a self-titled album using the 1980s musical style. Discharge's music influenced hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, grindcore and various extreme metal subgenres. The most well-known thrash metal bands covering Discharge songs include Metallica, Anthrax, and Sepultura.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Draped in the rich colours of African cloth, his trademark staff in hand, and his dreadlocks wrapped regally on his head, Anthony B embodies all that it is spiritual and proactive about Reggae music. This artiste has been steadfast in his mission to represent the poor and oppressed, using sharp lyrics to confront political injustices and bring the issues of the people to the forefront. In the process, he has raised the quality of performance standards and lyrical content for the industry, through the release of 13 albums, over 1000 singles and appearances on over 100 albums in the last 14 years. 

Anthony B's musical journey started in the church, back when he was still called Keith Anthony Blair in Clark's Town, Trelawney. In this part of rural Jamaica, Anthony B was immersed in the thunderous chants and rhythms of Revivalism and the Seventh Day Adventist church where he honed his soon-to-be signature vocals. In his formative years, the artiste also cleaved to the music of Otis Redding and the incomparable Peter Tosh. 

In 1992, Anthony B left his home-town and set out to make his fateful mark on Kingston's music scene. He rebuked the trend of girl and gun lyrics popular at that time and remained faithful to words of spiritual consciousness and social conviction. He started working with singer Little Devon, who introduced him to Richard "Bell" Bello, of Star Trail Records, producer for Garnet Silk and Everton Blender. Bell saw the talent of the youngster and shared his commitment to conscious music. 

The partnership produced a slew of records and releases, such as "Repentance time", "Fire pon Rome", "One Thing", "A De Man", "Rumour" and "Raid di Barn". Anthony B followed up with critically acclaimed albums such as " Real Revolutionary", "Universal Struggle", "7 Seals", "Black Star" and "Untouchable". He also struck out on his own to start his own label, Born Fire Records in 2002. He produced 3 albums independently; Street Knowledge, That's Life and Life Over Death. In addition he released two collaboration albums "Too Strong" with Sizzla and "Three Wise Men" with Sizzla and Luciano. 

Anthony B's lyrical genius and his captivating, energetic performance style have caused him to be heavily requested for performances in the Caribbean, North America, Europe and Africa. Anthony B personally rates his performance in 1999 at the Montrose Jazz Festival as a monumental event in his career. In 2003 and 2004, he was given a King's welcome in Gambia and Senegal. In 2004, he sold out shows in Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Belgium, France, Italy and Germany; closing for such greats as Israel Vibration and Burning Spear. 

He also opened up new regions for reggae music through his performances in New Dehli, India, Czech Republic, Iceland, Argentina, Venezuela and on France's Reunion Island, in the Indian Ocean. His heavy touring schedule has not slowed Anthony B's stream of releases. Over the years, he has collaborated with Bone Crusher, Akon, Wyclef Jean, Snoop Dogg, R. Kelly, Martina, an on his latest album, Toots. 

Anthony B's rich vocals and audacious lyrics carry a depth and substance which is rare in the industry. Internationally, his fan-base has grown because he speaks about the universal concerns of suffering and salvation. "The greatest thing about reggae music is that it's about concepts and ideas," says the artiste, "you are speaking to people on issues they live and can relate to."

            <description><![CDATA[Don’t be deceived by Beres Hammond’s cool profile. The playful smile, the unassuming demeanor, the beard and the cap and the spectacles might lull you into forgetting that you’re in the presence of an awesome musical talent, Jamaica’s greatest practicing singer/songwriter. Beres remains cool, though he knows that he’s one of a handful of people responsible for maintaining a mighty legacy of soulful reggae music—a select group of artists like Toots and Gregory, like Dennis and Bob. 

“Father bless me with a song,” he pleads on the last cut of his latest album, Music Is Life, “to make the whole world sing along. Regardless of the race, regardless of the taste.” In the year 2001, the blessings just keep coming, and the world is just starting to catch on.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Manley Augustus Buchanan (born 19 April 1949, Trenchtown, Kingston, Jamaica), better known as Big Youth (sometimes called Jah Youth), is a Jamaican deejay, mostly known for his work during the 1970s. He commented, "Deejays were closest to the people because there wasn't any kind of establishment control on the sound systems". 

The modern digital rhythms were far from suited to Big Youth's style, and his forays into the studio became less frequent. His appearance at Reggae Sunsplash in 1982 (he would appear another four times between 1983 and 1996) was well received, but his success during the 1980s was limited. His career revived in 1990, with the "Chanting" single, produced by Winston "Niney" Holness, and "Free South Africa" on the protest album One Man One Vote.

"Yes, me come inna de music as Rasta, me a de original rastaman who enter it." –Big Youth, Italy, 2001 In the 2000s Big Youth teamed up with modern dub producer Twilight Circus to record two notable singles 'Daniel in the Lions Den' & 'What We Need Is Love', in a style hearkening to the sound of Youth's vintage 70's classics.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Bunny Wailer (born Neville O'Riley Livingston, 10 April 1947), also known as Bunny Livingston and affectionately as Jah B, is a singer songwriter and percussionist and was an original member of reggae group The Wailers along with Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. A three-time Grammy award winner, he is considered one of the longtime standard-bearers of reggae music. He has been named by Newsweek as one of the three most important musicians in World music. After leaving the Wailers, Bunny became more focused on his spiritual faith. He identified with the Rastafari movement, as did the other Wailers. He has also written much of his own material as well as re-recording a number of cuts from the Wailers catalogue.

 Bunny Wailer has recorded primarily in the roots style, in keeping with his often political and spiritual messages. He and Tosh would frequently sing each other's background vocals in the start of their solo careers. The album Blackheart Man is a good example of his roots reggae style, while Sings the Wailers successfully reworks many of The Wailers songs with the backing of top Jamaican musicians, Sly and Robbie. He experimented with disco on his album Hook Line & Sinker. He has also had success recording in the typically apolitical, more pop, dancehall style. He has outlived his contemporaries in a culture where death by violence is commonplace.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[For over 30 years David Rodigan has been the top dog in the ganja-scented, bass heavy-atmosphere of Britain’s reggae dance-halls. The key to his success has been an unsinkable passion for reggae music, which first took a hold of him as a schoolboy when he heard ska music in the early ’60s. He developed an obsession with the music of Jamaica that generated an encyclopaedic knowledge of the island’s every artist, every song and every rhythm track.

His earliest experience of dee jaying was during lunch breaks once a week in the gym at Gosford Hill School in Kidlington, Oxford. On leaving school he landed a place at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama in 1971, where he spent three years studying to become an actor. He worked extensively in repertory theatre and appeared in a number of television productions such as ‘Doctor Who’ (BBC) and ‘Shackleton’ (BBC); he also performed his one-man show ‘Zima Junction’ at literature festivals and theatres in the 1970s; a dramatisation of the poem by the Russian writer Yevtushenko.

Rodigan began his reggae broadcasting career in 1978 on BBC Radio London. He moved to Capital Radio in 1979 and remained there for eleven years broadcasting his legendary ‘Roots Rockers’ show every Saturday night. His credibility was ensured when he began clashing with Jamaica’s champion DJ, Barry G on JBC Radio in Jamaica. He then went on to clash with all the top Jamaican sound systems in the West Indies, the USA and England.

In 1984 he joined BFBS (British Forces Broadcasting Corp) where broadcast his weekly reggae show for 25 years until 2009. In 1990 he joined the newly legalised Kiss 100 where he presented a variety of daytime shows for 10 years. He is still with Kiss 100 and his Reggae show can be heard every Sunday night at 11pm. In 2006 he was inducted into the Sony Radio Academy Hall Of Fame. He also won the Sony Radio Academy Gold Award for ‘Best Specialist Music Programme’ in 2009 for his Sunday night Kiss Show ‘Rodigan’s Reggae’. 

He plays his unique collection of customised dub plates and classic recordings extensively across Europe, especially in Italy and Germany, and in North America and the West Indies, to loyal reggae fans worldwide.

2012 was a truly vintage year for David. In Jan he was awarded an MBE for his services to broadcasting, in April he took home the World Cup Clash title in Queens NYC, and in May he was awarded his forth Sony Gold Award for his superb 13 part series on BBC Radio 2. 2012 also saw the launch of his 'Ram Jam' events brand, with numerous and festival tents across the UK. 2013 see's David join BBC Radio 1Xtra with a weekly show every Sunday evening 7-9pm, not to mention a new 13-part summer long series on BBC Radio 2. 

His Ram Jam event brand also hold’s a number of regional residencies and has regular curated stages at festivals across Europe including Parklife, Global Gathering, Bestival, Snowbombing, Outlook and Hideout alongside his continued and relentless worldwide touring schedule.

David has also just announced that alongside platinum selling act Chase & Status and the legendary Shy FX, they have joined forces as a new soundsystem under the collective name Rebel Sound, competing in the Red Bull Music Culture Clash at Earls Court on 30th Oct 2014.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Earl Sixteen (b. Earl John Daley, 9 May 1958, Kingston, Jamaica) is a reggae singer whose career began in the mid-1970s. Daley grew up in Waltham Park Road, Kingston, and, influenced by American soul and Jamaican artists such as Dennis Brown, began his singing career by entering local talent shows. He became the lead vocalist for the group The Flaming Phonics, playing live around Jamaica. Daley decided to drop out of school to pursue his music career, which prompted his mother to throw him out of the family home. Needing to make some money, the group tried out for producer Duke Reid, but left before finishing their recording for him due to his habit of firing live gunshots in the studio. They then worked with Herman Chin Loy, with Daley cutting his first solo track, "Hey baby". 

The group split up, with Daley concentrating on his solo career. Daley recorded "Malcolm X" for producer Joe Gibbs in 1975 - a track written by his school-friend Winston McAnuff, and which was later successfully covered by Dennis Brown. In 1977, he joined Boris Gardiner's group, The Boris Gardiner Happening, which brought him into contact with Lee "Scratch" Perry. In the late 1970s, after a spell with Derrick Harriott, Daley recorded four tracks at Perry's Black Ark studio, including the original recording of "White Belly Rat", also meeting Earl Morgan of The Heptones, who later produced his album, Shining Star. In the early 1980s he recorded singles for a variety of producers including Linval Thompson, Augustus Pablo, Clement Dodd, Sugar Minott, Yabby You, and Derrick Harriott, and recorded his debut album with Mikey Dread. He teamed up with Roy Cousins for two albums, Julie and Special Request. Earlier material recorded for Studio One was released as 1985's Showcase album.]]></description>

His music career began when he was seven years old. n a 2011 interview, he expressed concern that many veteran artists, including himself, struggled for local radio play of their newer material, which he felt may be "lost" over time as a result. His album Di Captain, released in August 2012, features Etana and Gappy Ranks. In 2013 he received a Marcus Garvey Lifetime Achievement Award from the Institute of Caribbean Studies.

            <description><![CDATA[Julian Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley and Barbados-born Lucy Pounder is a Grammy award nominated, roots-reggae musician, singer-songwriter, producer and humanitarian.In the same tradition as his father, Julian "Ju Ju" Marley is a devout Rastafarian whose music is inspired by life and spirituality. Born in London, England on June 4, 1975, Julian is the only son of Bob Marley born and raised in the U.K. Having been raised in England by his mother, Julian frequently visited his family and brothers Ziggy, Stephen, Damian and Kymani in Jamaica. 

Growing up as a youth in a musical atmosphere Julian quickly adopted a musical lifestyle and at an early age and became a skillful, self-taught musician mastering the bass, drums, guitar and keyboards. By the tender age of five, Marley recorded his first demo at the Marley family home in Kingston, Jamaica. Julian reflects, "From a small age music has been in my life, it was just a natural thing." 

During Julian's formative years in Jamaica, he began to study under legendary reggae veterans such as Aston "Family Man" Barrett, Carlton Barrett, Earl "Wire" Lindo, Tyrone Downie and Earl "Chinna" Smith, all of whom inspired the then fledgling song-bird. In 1987 when influential Wailers drummer Carlton Barrett was murdered outside of his home in Jamaica , Julian wrote two un-released songs , 'Uprising' and 'What They Did Wrong' in response to the incident.

Subsequently he also formed a band called The Uprising, a roots-reggae band comprised of young Jamaican players. Julian and the Uprising would go on to open up for his brother Ziggy Marley's band, The Melody Makers and performed with The Wailers which at one time included Carlton Barrett's son on drums.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The year is 2069. After years of travel across the galaxy Major Lazer has returned to Earth from his triumphant interstellar campaign against his mentor-turned-arch-nemesis General Rubbish. The victory rings hollow, though–there is something he left out among the stars that he can never replace. The world he’s come back to is missing something too: unity. 

In his absence Earth has been transformed into a worldwide maelstrom of conflicting armies, gangs, cults, and crews. The Fearless Hyenas, the Deathless Lovers, the Pitch Black Knights of the Inner Wild–a multitude of factions, each of them sworn enemies of every other. Having proven himself adept at the art of war, Major Lazer has dedicated himself now to becoming a champion of peace.

With help from a squad of anarcho-pacifist hackers, he’s taken control of a top secret network of military satellites and repurposed it into a global sound system to broadcast a righteous dub designed to unite the tribes of Earth and overthrow those who have thrown them into disarray for their own personal gain. Peace is the mission, and the fate of the world depends on its success.

The two time Grammy award winning DJ and producer Diplo (aka Wesley Pentz) has had an unprecedented career that’s taken him from the outer fringes of club culture to the top of pop’s A-list. He first drew the attention of forward-looking listeners in the mid-aughts through zeitgeist-smashing DJ sets that defied the borders of geography and genre, as well as the Piracy Funds Terrorism Vol. 1 mixtape he created with M.I.A. His commercial breakthrough came with her 2007 hit “Paper Planes,” which reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for a Grammy for Record of the Year.

Since then he’s split his time between working with pop stars (Beyonce, Usher, Snoop Dogg, No Doubt, Lil Wayne, Justin Bieber, Iggy Azalea, Britney Spears, Chris Brown, and Madonna among them) and carving out a niche as one of the leading figures in EDM culture, in the process racking up over 13 million track sales (and 12 million Spotify streams a month) as both a producer and an artist. One of the world’s most sought-after DJs, he’s also a world-class tastemaker who’s appeared on the covers of Fast Company and Billboard and lent his creative talents to brands like Alexander Wang and Blackberry. His label Mad Decent has spawned a roster of cutting-edge dance music acts, as well as a 22-city annual touring festival, its own themed cruise, & new to 2017; a beach party that will be held over 4 days in Mexico.

Currently made up of Diplo and fellow DJ/producers Jillionaire and Walshy Fire, Major Lazer’s latest album, Peace is the Mission, was released in June 2015 to widespread critical acclaim. Lead single “Lean On,” featuring DJ Snake and Mø, took the world by storm, becoming the most successful independently released song of all time after peaking at #1 on the Top 40 chart, becoming the most streamed song on Spotify of all time with more than 673 million streams to date, is currently the #1 most played track on Soundcloud, and became one of only a handful of videos to reach 1 billion views on YouTube. 

“Lean On” is certified ten times platinum in the Netherlads, eight times Platinum in Sweden, five times Platinum in Norway, four times Platinum in Australia and New Zealand, three times Platinum in Italy and Spain, two times Platinum in the U.S., Switzerland & U.K., Belgium, Finland, and Brazil, and Platinum in Germany. Major Lazer was the most-Shazamed artist of 2015 and is the third most-streamed artist on Soundcloud of all time. Peace is the Mission debuted at #1 on he Billboard Dance/Electronic albums chart and has spawned further hits including “Light It Up” featuring Nyla and Fuse ODG and “Powerful” with Ellie Goulding and Tarrus Reilly.

Launched in 2008 alongside his fellow “Paper Planes” producer Switch, Major Lazer is Diplo’s outlet for his lifelong love of Jamaican dancehall music. Their wildly popular 2009 single “Pon de Floor” is an EDM touchstone that singlehandedly reshaped the sound of contemporary dance music, and provided the foundation for Beyonce’s chart-topping single “Run the World.” Over the course of two albums and three EPs they’ve not only collaborated with the likes of Bruno Mars, Pharrell Williams, and Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend, but have earned the respect of venerated Jamaican dancehall artists like Busy Signal, Vybz Kartel, and Elephant Man, all of whom have graced their tracks.

They’ve also become fixtures on the festival circuit, headlining Coachella, Glastonbury, Ultra Music Festival, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The group’s cartoon series based on the character Major Lazer debuted last year on Fox and Diplo’s BBC Radio show “Diplo and Friends” continues to enjoy success.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Bastille are an English indie rock band formed in 2010. They began as a solo project by singer-songwriter Dan Smith, who later decided to form a band. The four-piece is completed by Chris 'Woody' Wood, William Farquarson and Kyle Simmons. They recently added a touring member to the band, Charlie Barnes. The name of the band derives from Bastille Day, which is celebrated on 14 July, Smith's birthday.

After an independently released debut single and a self-released EP, the band signed to Virgin Records. Their first studio album, Bad Blood, was released in March 2013 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1. The band was nominated for four Brit Awards at the 2014 ceremony, winning the British Breakthrough Act. As of November 2014, Bastille have sold over 5 million records in the US and 2.5 million records in the UK]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell) July 8, 1970), known by the stage name Beck, is an American singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist. He rose to fame in the early 1990s with his lo-fi, sonically experimental style, and he became well known for creating musical collages of a wide range of styles. His later recordings encompass folk, funk, soul, hip hop, alternative rock, country and psychedelia. He has released 12 studio albums, as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music.

Born in Los Angeles in 1970, Beck discovered hip hop and folk music in his teens and began to perform locally at coffeehouses and clubs. He moved to New York City in 1989 and became involved in the city's small but intense anti-folk movement. After returning to his hometown in the early 1990s, he cut his breakthrough single "Loser", which became a worldwide hit in 1994. His 1996 album Odelay produced hit singles, topped critic polls and won several awards. He released the stripped-down Mutations in 1998, and the funk-infused Midnite Vultures in 1999. The downcast, acoustic Sea Change (2002) showcased a more serious Beck, and 2005's Guero returned to sample-based production. 

The Information (2006) was inspired by electro-funk and hip hop, and Modern Guilt (2008), likewise, by 1960s music. In February 2014, Beck released the album Morning Phase. It won Album of the Year at the 57th Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015. With a pop art collage of musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern arrangements incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being among the most creative and idiosyncratic musicians of 1990s and 2000s alternative rock. 

Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are Odelay and Sea Change, both of which were ranked on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The four-time platinum artist has collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks. Beck is married to actress Marissa Ribisi, and is a Scientologist.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Bloc Party are an English indie rock band, currently composed of Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, sampler), Russell Lissack (lead guitar, keyboards), Justin Harris (bass guitar, keyboards, saxophones, backing vocals) and Louise Bartle (drums). Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. 

Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. 

Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo "She's Hearing Voices".]]></description>

The band consists of frontman Kieran Shudall (vocals, guitar), Sam Rourke (bass), Colin Jones (drums) and Joe Falconer (guitarist). Shudall met both Rourke and Plummer through mutual friends at Liverpool Sound City in 2013, meeting Falconer not long after at the same festival where he worked as a stage manager. During the summer and autumn of 2013 the band played several short UK tours, which included some secret shows.

Or, as Isaac Newton stated, what goes up must come down — that is, everything except Clutch.Earth Rocker created an insurmountable peak. But Psychic Warfare has altered laws of physics by elevating the smart songwriting and impressive performances of that last album, setting an even higher benchmark as their now-definitive album to date. 

The eleventh Clutch studio album Psychic Warfare goes straight for the throat with “X-Ray Visions” and never lets go.  Working again with acclaimed producer Machine, this time in Texas, the concise arrangements that made Earth Rocker so assertive is the same harness for the combustible musical energy on Psychic Warfare.

            <description><![CDATA[Editors are an English rock band, formed in 2002 in Stafford. Previously known as Pilot, The Pride and Snowfield, the band currently consists of Tom Smith (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Russell Leetch (bass guitar, synthesizer, backing vocals), Ed Lay (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Justin Lockey (lead guitar), and Elliott Williams (keys, synthesizers, guitars, and backing vocals). Editors have so far released two platinum studio albums, and five in total, with several million combined sales. Their debut album The Back Room was released in 2005. It contained the hits "Munich" and "Blood" and the following year received a Mercury Prize nomination.

Their follow-up album An End Has a Start went to number 1 in the UK Album Chart in June 2007 and earned the band a Brit Awards nomination for best British Band. It also spawned another Top 10 hit single, "Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors". The band's third album, In This Light and on This Evening, was released in October 2009 and went straight to number 1 in the UK Album Chart. The band released their fourth studio album, The Weight of Your Love, in July 2013, followed by self-produced In Dream in October 2015.

Alongside their critical acclaim and strong success in the charts, Editors have consistently enjoyed sold-out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. Their brand of dark indie rock is commonly compared to the sound of bands such as Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, Interpol, The Chameleons and U2.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Explosions in the Sky is an American post-rock band from Texas. The quartet originally played under the name Breaker Morant, then changed to the current name in 1999. The band has garnered popularity beyond the post-rock scene for their elaborately developed guitar work, narratively styled instrumentals, what they refer to as "cathartic mini-symphonies," and their enthusiastic and emotional live shows. 

They primarily play with three electric guitars and a drum kit, although band member Michael James will at times exchange his electric guitar for a bass guitar. Recently the band has added a fifth member to their live performances. The band's music is almost purely instrumental.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Flogging Molly has never conformed to industry tastes; they’ve always been the outcasts who put their fans before commercial success, and they’ve always put their music before marketability. The rewards of such independence and integrity are undeniable on Speed of Darkness. You feel it from the first note to the last, the pathos and the passion, the sweeping and rollicking electricity of inspiration. 

Founded in Los Angeles in 1997, Flogging Molly has always defied categorization. The infectious originality of their songs is a badge of honor and key to the band’s creativity, their urgency. They infuse punk rock with Celtic instruments—violin, mandolin and the accordion—and they merge blues progressions with grinding guitars and traditional Irish music, the music of King’s youth. “We're not a traditional band," explains Dublin-born King. "We are influenced by traditional music and inspired by it, but without question we put our own twist on it." 

Theirs is music of exile and rebellion, of struggle and history and protest. It’s music of a country torn down the middle; a deeply beautiful and wounded country that knows no quit, and Flogging Molly pays homage to that resolve in every note. Whether it’s a driving anthem like “Black Friday Rule” or the upbeat duet with Lucinda Williams, “Factory Girls”, the band’s only criteria for its music is simple and bone-deep: that it matter.]]></description>

Also in 2015, the band was the headlining act at Glastonbury Festival, making Florence Welch the first British female headliner this century.

            <description><![CDATA[Fun Lovin' Criminals is a band from New York City. Their musical style is eclectic, covering styles such as hip hop, rock, blues, jazz, soul, punk, and funk. They are best known for their hit "Scooby Snacks", which features samples from films by Quentin Tarantino, and the song "Love Unlimited", which recalls Barry White's backing vocal group. Their songs often focus on life in New York City, as well as urban life in general. 

Their lyrics can be gritty or existentialist in nature, touching on topics such as organized crime and urban violence, but they are just as often humorous or satirical. According to Huey Morgan, the band has sold approximately 10 million albums worldwide. The band gained a large following internationally, notably in northwest Europe, around the release of their first two albums in the late nineties.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Joakim Nilsson, Rikard Edlund (both formerly of Norrsken), Axel Sjöberg, and Truls Mörck formed Graveyard in 2006. When Norrsken disbanded in 2000, guitarist Magnus Pelander went on to form doomy folk metal act Witchcraft and Nilsson and Edlund joined Albatross, a growly blues rock band whose lineup also included Sjöberg on drums. Initially they considered Albatross a hobby project, but after five years the members began taking their music more seriously and had grown dissatisfied with the direction their sound had taken.

When Albatross broke up, Nilsson and Edlund decided that for their next venture, they would head back towards their roots as musicians and songwriters. Nilsson explains, “I am a singer, but in Albatross I only played guitar. Rikard played guitar but he is a bass player. We also wanted a more straightforward sound]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Few bands have won hearts as quickly as Kaiser Chiefs in recent years. They scored right from the first single, and just kept racing ahead. After Oh My God came Everyday I Love You Less and Less, I Predict a Riot, Ruby, Never Miss a Beat … The Brits made their Werchter debut in 2006 and went straight onto the mainstage, which was the start of an unprecedented four-in-a-row (2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009). But then things turned sour. 

The British music press predicted a downward spiral from which Kaiser Chiefs wouldn’t return. To make matters worse, Nick Hodgson, the drummer and key song writer, left the band. It was a wake-up call. Singer Ricky Wilson woke up and took the bull by the horns. Kaiser Chiefs is once again what made it so good in the past: funny, energetic and pretty disturbed. The Kaisers of the sing-along tunes will be coming for the sixth time, putting them in the dizzy heights of The Cure and Metallica.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Rivalry can sometimes create a healthy dynamic. Just ask Kensington, the hard-working band that placed conflict at the centre of ‘Rivals’. Recorded in Berlin, ‘Rivals’ is in many ways the next step in this promising band’s evolution. What singer Eloi finds the most pleasing is how the album thematically follows on from its predecessor ‘Vultures’, whilst also being its complete opposite. Eloi explains: “It was about the rivalry with the people around me, whom I sometimes criticize. 

On ‘Rivals’ I asked the question: can I now criticize myself?” He found he could, and it makes for some intriguing listening. The songs are introvert in nature, whilst also possessing a majestic sound. The opening track ‘Streets’ is a prime example, with its anthem-like quality, meant for a heart-warming sing-along, and impossible to get out of your head after just one listen. Similarly, ‘War’, despite its title, has a sunny vibe that could bring any festival ground or large venue to boiling point.

Rivalry may well be the theme for this album, but don’t think for a minute that these four young musicians insist on travelling in separate tour buses. They do occasionally quarrel over a drumbeat or guitar riff though, confesses drummer Niles: “When you write songs with four people, it always causes tension of a good variety. The rivalry helps us create something together which, in the end, is the very essence of Kensington.” Mixed by the Grammy Award-winning Tom Lord-Alge (Rolling Stones, The Cure, No Doubt) Kensington sculpted a big, dynamic soundscape. Guitarist Casper reveals why Lord-Alge was the right man for the job. 

“We wanted to hear the power and energy of our live gigs on this album.” Eloi continues: “We really went the extra mile, especially in the production. We know what we want and how to achieve it. We thought things through more and didn’t quit until we were completely satisfied.”

The moods of the ten tracks shift effortlessly between solemn and jubilant, often within seconds. Eloi’s distinctive voice personifies autumn itself at times, contrasting surprisingly with the often summery guitar sounds and upbeat rhythms. “At the same time, some of the songs are louder”, thinks bassist Jan. “We’ve really set ourselves no limits to what we can do.

”Indeed, ‘Rivals’ harbours huge commercial potential without ever losing its artistic integrity. It’s the result of a band reaching maturity, after years of sold-out club tours, massive festival gigs, chart successes and countless accolades, including an MTV Award.

Some of the band’s experiences have left their marks on Eloi’s lyrics, again fitting in with the album’s theme. “The rivalry I sing about is the conflict within yourself. It’s about the stark contrast of playing in front of 20,000 people one day, and wanting to be just by myself the next, not talking to anyone.” Moods such as these don’t last long though. 

The band is always looking forward to the next gig, always striving to get better, says the singer. “What’s most important is whether this is going to work out for us. All the side issues, like the temptations of the road, will never overshadow our work ethic.” He laughs: “The other day we were even too tired to go out and celebrate the gold record for our single ‘Streets’.”

Kensington think of themselves as a new generation band, according to Eloi. “Album sales don’t speak for themselves anymore. You have to work really hard to make a living in this business nowadays, and that is exactly what we do.” He recounts how the band borrowed money from Casper’s mother to finance Vultures. “If that album had failed, we’d be in deep trouble, with no money, no education and with a huge debt. We really jumped in at the deep end: a testament to how much we believe in this thing.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Kings of Leon is an American rock band that formed in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2000. The band is composed of brothers Caleb Followill (b. January 14, 1982, lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Nathan Followill (b. June 26, 1979, drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Jared Followill (b. November 20, 1986, bass guitar, backing vocals), with their cousin Matthew Followill (b. September 10, 1984, lead guitar, backing vocals). The band's early music was a blend of Southern rock and blues influences, but it has gradually expanded throughout the years to include a variety of genres and a more alternative, arena rock sound. Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band's albums at the time peaked in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album, Because of the Times, also reached the number one spot. After the release of Only by the Night in September 2008 the band achieved chart success in the United States. 

The singles "Sex on Fire", "Use Somebody", and "Notion" all peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album was their first Platinum-selling album in the United States, and was also the best-selling album of 2008 in Australia, being certified platinum nine times. The band's fifth album, Come Around Sundown, was released on October 18, 2010. Their sixth album, Mechanical Bull, was released on September 24, 2013. A seventh studio album is currently in pre-production, and is set to be released by the end of 2016, according to drummer Nathan Followill via Associated Press in December of 2015. The group has 7 Grammy award nominations, including 3 wins.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Five musicians take the audience on a rollercoaster ride by ingeniously cutting, copying, and pasting unexpected combinations of killer tracks from very different genres into highly explosive (s)mashups.

- Chemical Brothers vs the Kinks vs S-Express
- Swedish House Maffia vs Madcon vs Guns 'n Roses
- House of Pain vs Jimi Hendrix vs Kosheen
and much, much more..

Memphis Maniacs is conceptually often compared with 2manydjs but their show offers the overwhelming performance of an insane live band that does so much more than mixing lyrics and music. Musical boundaries will be brutally defied. No tapes, no backing tracks, no sequencers. Expect a massive party with rock&roll attitude and a dancefloor that makes you gasp for breath!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Muse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion). Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing an aggressive and melancholic style. 

Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), expanded their sound, combining Bellamy's falsetto, heavier riffs, wider instrumentation, and romantic classical influences. It earned them mainstream European success and a reputation for energetic live performances. Their third album, Absolution (2003), saw further classical influences, incorporating orchestra on tracks such as "Butterflies and Hurricanes", and brought American success, producing hit singles including "Time is Running Out".

Muse's fourth album, Black Holes and Revelations (2006), incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 80s groups such as Depeche Mode. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explore lyrical themes of government oppression and uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), is a concept album about drone warfare and returns to a harder rock sound.

Muse have won numerous music awards including five MTV Europe Music Awards, eight NME Awards, two Brit Awards, and two Grammy Awards from seven nominations, winning Best Rock Album for The Resistance and Drones. They have sold more than 20 million albums worldwide.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[New Order, an English rock band, consists of ten studio albums, twelve compilation albums, three live albums, five extended plays (EPs), thirty-eight singles, twelve video releases, thirty-three music videos and a number of soundtrack appearances. New Order were formed in 1980 by singer and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The group began life as a continuation of their former incarnation Joy Division. Joy Division had disbanded after the death of the lead singer Ian Curtis. Gillian Gilbert, who was Morris' girlfriend at the time, soon joined the group and played guitar and keyboards.

Remarkably, New Order's first eight singles released between 1981 and 1984 were not taken from any album. In most cases they were not even released as a 7-inch, but exclusively available in the radio-unfriendly 12-inch format, an unusual approach for a pop-act in the eighties. Despite the high anticipation that surrounded the group, their debut single "Ceremony" only peaked at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's following two singles and their debut album met with similar moderate success. It would not be until the release of their fourth single, "Blue Monday", that New Order would break into the top ten, with the song peaking at number 9. "Blue Monday" became a defining single for the group and caused a sensation, becoming the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Polly Jean Harvey, MBE (born 9 October 1969), known as PJ Harvey, is an English musician, singer-songwriter, writer, poet, and composer. Primarily known as a vocalist and guitarist, she is also proficient with a wide range of instruments.
Harvey began her career in 1988 when she joined local band Automatic Dlamini as a vocalist, guitarist, and saxophone player. The band's frontman, John Parish, would become her long-term collaborator. 

In 1991, she formed an eponymous trio and subsequently began her professional career. The trio released two studio albums, Dry (1992) and Rid of Me (1993) before disbanding, after which Harvey continued as a solo artist. Since 1995, she has released a further six studio albums with collaborations from various musicians including John Parish, former bandmate Rob Ellis, Mick Harvey, and Eric Drew Feldman and has also worked extensively with record producer Flood.

Among the accolades she has received are the 2001 and 2011 Mercury Prize for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea (2000) and Let England Shake (2011) respectively—the only artist to have been awarded the prize twice—eight Brit Award nominations, six Grammy Award nominations and two further Mercury Prize nominations. 

Rolling Stone awarded her 1992's Best New Artist and Best Singer Songwriter and 1995's Artist of the Year, and listed Rid of Me, To Bring You My Love (1995) and Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. In 2011, she was awarded for Outstanding Contribution To Music at the NME Awards. In June 2013, she was awarded an MBE for services to music.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Primal Scream are a Scottish rock band originally formed in 1982 in Glasgow by Bobby Gillespie (vocals) and Jim Beattie. The current lineup consists of Gillespie, Andrew Innes (guitar), Martin Duffy (keyboards), Simone Butler (bass) and Darrin Mooney (drums). Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert "Throb" Young. The band performed throughout 1982–1984, but their career did not take off until Gillespie left his position as drummer of The Jesus and Mary Chain.

The band were a key part of the mid-1980s indie pop scene, but eventually moved away from their more jangly sound, taking on more psychedelic and then garage rock influences, before incorporating a dance music element to their sound. Their 1991 album Screamadelica broke the band into the mainstream. Their latest album Chaosmosis was released on 18 March 2016.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[I've known Red Fang for a long time — from before their very humble beginnings in 1972, even. I knew them in the early days when they were grody dirt wizards that you never wanted to see with their shirts off. But there we were in Teeksville, Vermont, at 4 a.m. After literally burning the club to the ground following their poorly attended set, I'm pounding on the door of the cutest little bed and breakfast you've ever laid eyes on with a very drunk and hungry Red Fang demanding a pancake breakfast — topless.

In the years since, a few things have changed: The band successfully rescued guitarist David Sullivan from a hoarding situation (featured on the "If The House Is a Rockin'..." episode of Hoarders),bassist/vocalist Aaron Beam received his master's degree in the Smooooth Sciences, guitarist/vocalist Bryan Giles started the world’s first 100-perecent anti-organic farm in his kitchen, and drummer John Sherman has climbed Mt. Everest in the nude, making him only the third person ever to do so. And none of them wets the bed anymore! That's just the stuff that's been on the news. They've also been touring the world like mad, playing to thousands of sweaty, hygienically-challenged maniacs at festivals and non-ventilated venues alike. They've made several award-winning music videos that have lots and lots of views because they're hilarious and awesome. Then this spring, they jogged 14 miles round trip to the studio everyday for 666 days and recorded a new record called Whales and Leeches.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Red Hot Chili Peppers, also sometimes shortened to "The Chili Peppers" or abbreviated as "RHCP", is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith; and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late-2009, replacing John Frusciante. 

Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards and have become one of the best-selling bands of all time with over 80 million records sold worldwide. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea. Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's self-titled debut album (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on the second and third albums by the band Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987), but he died from a heroin overdose in 1988. 

As a result of his friend's death, Irons chose to depart from the group as drummer. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak, though his tenure was short, which forced Frusciante to replace him in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons. His tenure was also short, so he was replaced by Chad Smith that same year.

The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante, and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with Mother's Milk (1989). In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) under producer Rick Rubin. This album became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour.

After two temporary guitarists, Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction joined for the group's subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. 

The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 16 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number-one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band in 2009 to focus on his solo career. Klinghoffer who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, replaced him as lead guitarist. 

The band's tenth studio album, I'm with You, was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries. The group toured into 2014 and performed with Bruno Mars as a part of the halftime performance at Super Bowl XLVIII. The band is recording their eleventh studio album with producer Danger Mouse; the album is expected to be released in 2016.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Skunk Anansie are a British band whose members include Skin (lead vocals, guitar), Cass (guitar, bass, backing vocals), Ace (guitar, backing vocals) and Mark Richardson (drums and percussion). Skunk Anansie formed in March 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name "Skunk Anansie" is taken from Akann folk tales of Anansi the spider-man of Ghana, with "Skunk" added to "make the name nastier". 

They have released six studio albums: Paranoid & Sunburnt (1995), Stoosh (1996), Post Orgasmic Chill (1999), Wonderlustre (2010), Black Traffic (2012) and Anarchytecture (2016); one compilation album, Smashes and Trashes (2009); and several hit singles, including "Charity", "Hedonism", "Selling Jesus" and "Weak".

They are often grouped as part of a Britrock movement, running alongside Britpop. The band, in 2004, was named as one of the most successful UK chart acts between 1952 and 2003 by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, with a total of 141 weeks on both the singles and album charts ranking them at No. 491. When the book first published this annual top 500 list in 2000, it only involved weeks spent on the singles chart until 2004's 17th edition, meaning the band's highest ranking has not been notified in any of the past editions.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Suede are an English alternative rock band, formed in London in 1989 and currently consists of singer Brett Anderson, guitarist Richard Oakes, bass player Mat Osman, drummer Simon Gilbert and keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Neil Codling. Having split up in 2003, the Coming Up/Head Music line-up of the band reformed in 2010. The band's original guitarist Bernard Butler left the band in 1994. In 1992, Suede were described as "The Best New Band in Britain", and attracted much attention from the British music press. 

The following year their debut album Suede, went to the top of the charts by becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. It won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster Britpop as a musical genre. However, the band's follow-up, Dog Man Star (1994), showed Suede distancing themselves from their Britpop peers. The recording sessions for Dog Man Star were fraught with difficulty, and ended with Butler departing the band after confrontations with the rest of the band. The album was completed without Butler, with the band touring the album with new recruit Richard Oakes. Although a commercial disappointment at the time, the album was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has, over time been lauded with universal acclaim from critics.

In 1996, following the further recruitment of keyboard player Neil Codling along with Oakes, Suede went on to greater commercial success with Coming Up. The album reached number one in the UK, producing five top ten singles and becoming Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide. In 1997, Anderson became addicted to crack and heroin. Despite problems within the band, Suede's fourth album Head Music (1999) was a British chart-topper. The album was promoted heavily with the band receiving considerable press coverage on its release, however it garnered a mixed reaction dividing fans and critics alike. 

Codling left the band in 2001, citing chronic fatigue syndrome and was replaced by Alex Lee. The band's fifth album, A New Morning (2002), the first following the collapse of Nude Records, was a commercial disappointment, and the group disbanded the following year. After much speculation Suede reformed in 2010 for a series of concerts. Three years on from their reunion gigs, Suede released their sixth album, Bloodsports. It was well received by critics and returned the band to the top ten in the UK. Night Thoughts (2016) was an even greater critical and commercial success than its predecessor.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[It didn't take long for Montreal's Suuns to resurface with a second full length, Images Du Futur, and, as one would anticipate, this latest exploration takes on even greater visceral depths. At the outset it appears we're still ensconced in the warehouse, whether it's the grinding opening explosives of "Powers of Ten" or the crude, ominous rise-and-fall riffs in "2020." Broken up by Ben Shemie's melodious and angst-ridden murmurs, the industrial low-end throb presides early on, lulling us into thinking the band has picked up right where they left off with their debut LP, Zeroes QC. 

"Minor Work" builds steadily around a nostalgic, fuzz-infused beat and bares a soothing, contagious harmony. "Mirror Mirror" departs from the frenzied earlier pace, decelerating to a lethargic drawl; the droning, almost tedious undertones are paid off with flurries of synthesized flute that announce the dawn of the dreamscape ahead. We aren't to be disappointed.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Tenacious D is an American comedy rock duo that was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1994. Composed of lead vocalist and guitarist Jack Black and lead guitarist and vocalist Kyle Gass, the band has released three albums – Tenacious D (2001), The Pick of Destiny (2006) and Rize of the Fenix (2012). Tenacious D's studio releases, and (as of 2006) its live performances, feature a full band lineup, including such musicians as guitarist John Konesky and bassist John Spiker. Drummer Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters, Nirvana) has played on every studio release.

The band first gained popularity in 1997 when they starred in their eponymous television series and began to support large rock acts. In 2001, they released Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band. The first single, "Tribute," was the band's most successful achieving their only Top 10 in any chart, until they released "The Metal", which was shown on Saturday Night Live. In 2006, they starred in, and recorded the soundtrack for, the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In support of the film, the band went on a world tour, appearing for the first time with a full band. They released their newest album Rize of the Fenix on May 15, 2012.

Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as "mock rock". Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1976. The band has experienced several line-up changes, with vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the only constant member. The Cure first began releasing music in the late 1970s with their debut album Three Imaginary Boys; this, along with several early singles, placed the band as part of the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly dark and tormented music was a staple of the emerging gothic rock genre.

After the release of 1982's Pornography, the band's future was uncertain and Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired. With the single "Let's Go to Bed" released the same year, Smith began to place a pop sensibility into the band's music and their popularity increased as the decade wore on, with songs like "Just Like Heaven", "Lovesong" and "Friday I'm in Love". The band is estimated to have sold 27 million albums as of 2004 and have released thirteen studio albums, ten EPs and over thirty singles during their career.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Darkness are a UK rock band currently seeking out an existence on the periphery of the world music scene. Surrounded by a team of highly paid professional technicians, our heroes battle irrelevance in obscurity, paying themselves a meagre minimum wage so as to keep it real. The Darkness’ live performances have become legendary. Or mythological.  

The absence of an official live DVD means you have to witness a show first hand before you are entitled to slag it off. Then, and only then, may you slag it off. I wager you won’t, because the Darkness will make you shit in your pants, in a good way. I should know. I’m the singer. Justin Hawkins]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[2013 is a landmark year for Tindersticks who turn 21 this year. In this time they have recorded nine studio albums, composed music for films, museums, fashion shows and installations, have toured the world, played with various orchestras, dueted and collaborated with many great singers and musicians, lost their desire, split up, rearranged, reformed, re-kindled their musical passion and in 2012 made what they, and many critics consider to be one of their finest albums The Something Rain.

Tindersticks wanted to mark this special anniversary year in some way, to connect this history with what they have become. After much discussion they entered the legendary Studio 2 at Abbey Road and from 6th – 9th April 2013 recorded Across six leap years, their 10th studio album; 10 new versions of songs from throughout their history. Across the years some songs were “lost along the way”. For one reason or another they never became how they were imagined to be in their recorded form…until now. Across Six Leap Years brings together these previously unrealised tracks as part celebration, part reinvention.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released nine studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5.

Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current "eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres."[6]

Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed "how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century."[7] Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco's most recent studio album, Star Wars, was released on July 16, 2015.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[DeWolff are a psychedelic rock band from the Netherlands’ deep south, formed in 2007 by brothers Pablo & Luka van de Poel and Robin Piso. When their psychedelic yet hard rocking, self-titled EP was released in 2008 it immediately conquered the hearts of rock music lovers all across the country and in December 2008 the band played their first show at Paradiso, a legendary venue in Amsterdam. The release of their 2009 debut album “Strange Fruits and Undiscovered Plants” was followed by a successful tour through the Netherlands and Germany. In 2010, then still aged 15, 18 and 19, DeWolff played in front of an audience of 10,000 at Europe’s oldest music festival Pinkpop.

In late 2010 DeWolff recorded their second album “Orchards/Lupine”. This record was released in January 2011 and immediately made it to #11 in the Dutch album charts, a huge accomplishment for a young alternative rock band in nowadays’ musical climate. The tour that followed the release of “Orchards/Lupine” completely sold out and in August 2011 DeWolff played in front of an audience of 15,000 at the Hungarian Sziget festival and in front of 30,000 people at the Dutch Lowlands festival.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Since they formed eleven years ago in Roma, Italian trio BLACK RAINBOWS have established themselves as one of the most active fuzz-fueled rock acts in Europe, with four albums, a remarkable handful of EPs (including a split record with L.A.'s space rockers Farflung) and countless tours and festival appearances across the continent. Blending the drive and swagger of 70's hard rock with the sun-baked thickness of 90's stoner rock, BLACK RAINBOWS have managed to create their own sound imprint, that could be described as "Hawkwind, MC-5 and Nebula crashing cars in the middle of the Mojave desert". Closely following with their highly acclaimed effort "Hawkdope", the band is set to deliver another tasty piece of their fuzzy cake with fifth full-length "Stellar Prophecy", out this spring on Heavy Psych Sounds.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Savages is a rock band from London and lead singer and lyricist Jehnny Beth (real name: Camille Berthomier) is from France. The band's guitarist Gemma Thompson had come up with the name for the band and had been discussing the idea with singer Jehnny Beth for almost a year. Thompson says the band's name was derived from books, such as Lord of the Flies, that she read when she was younger. 

The band was eventually formed in October 2011 and they had their first gig in January 2012 supporting rock band British Sea Power. Their manager John Best also manages Sigur Ros. The Observer has said of Savages: "it's not exactly sexy, it's not funny and they're not going to be rolling around in mud like the Slits. But it's the closest thing to art that "post-punk"... has offered in a while". The New Musical Express described their performances as "frottage-inducingly intense affairs".]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Dinosaur Jr. is now widely recognized as one of the most significant American rock bands of all time; the sound they pioneered in the late-80s having permeated through the past 20 years. Preceding Nirvana by several years, they were instrumental in bringing the crashing sounds of lead guitar back to indie rock. It wasn't just their signature metallic haze that made an impression on listeners; their effects-laden guitars were wrapped around some of the best songwriting of the decade. 

The first three albums -- Dinosaur, You're Living All Over Me and Bug -- were cult masterpieces and when the original line up of Mascis, Barlow and drummer Murph re-formed in 2005 for select live dates it was apparent that the years apart had not eroded any of their vitality. In fact, many critics claimed their shows were even better than they used to be. It was natural, then, that the band would begin to work on new material.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Influenced by psychedelica, blues and steaming rock&roll this trio takes you back to the old times of MC5, The Doors and even Pink Floyd! With a drumplayer that could be Keith Moon's son, an organist that harrases his instrument to death and a singer/guitarist that seems to be the power version of Jim Morrison, this band is bound to catapult psychedelic sixties rock&roll back into our modern times. Forget about all those indie hipster bands and prepare for some real sleeze&roll. These guys are it and will rock your socks off for sure!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[McBriare Samuel Lanyon "Mac" DeMarco (born Vernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV, April 30, 1990) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer. He is best known for his solo career, during which he has released four studio albums, Rock and Roll Night Club (2012), 2 (2012), Salad Days (2014), and Another One (2015). His style of music has been creatively described as "blue wave", "slacker rock", or self-described by DeMarco as the non-sequitur "jizz jazz". 

DeMarco's style of music is easily recognizable via its use of low bass, punchy drums and a generally hazy atmosphere a la soft rock records, along with a Lennon-esque vocal style which has also been compared to Damon Albarn of Blur. He has also mentioned Shuggie Otis, Steely Dan, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Jonathan Richman and The Grateful Dead as favorite artists. His guitar-based compositions have moved from glam-inspired works to what reviewers describe as "off-kilter pop]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Madness are an English ska band from Camden Town, London, that formed in 1976. One of the most prominent bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 Tone ska revival, they continue to perform with their most recognised line-up of seven members.

Madness achieved most of their success in the early to mid-1980s. Both Madness and UB40 spent 214 weeks on the UK singles charts over the course of the decade, holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts. However, Madness achieved this in a shorter time period (1980–1986). Madness have had 15 singles reach the UK top ten, one UK number one single ("House of Fun") and two number ones in Ireland, "House of Fun" and "Wings of a Dove".]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Bremen’s Bebetta is a playful, colourful and charming personality who likes to inject everything she does with a sense of fun. Her goal is to make people happy away from the troubles of every day life. In order to make this happen, she has years of DJing and music collecting experiences to call upon, so she always knows exactly what record is right for the moment. Since 2008 she has been doing her thing, and in the process has won the Tresor Newcomer Award for her impressive DJ sets around Berlin, but also further afield across Europe.

Her considered sound touches on house and tech with a real focus on melody, driving drums and emotional sensitivity and the DJ’s own personality always manages to shine through in the sets she lays down. Those often come at Heimlich, the party she started in 2011 in the Hanseatic city of Bremen, whilst similar vibes also pervade her own productions, which have been offered up by labels including Damm Records, Patro De Musica and Kallias. These standout releases are often full of inventive, off kilter tracks with hooky melodies, lush chords and original ideas a world way from the norm. 

With a name loosely taken from the English words ‘be better,’ Bebetta is all about community, about bringing people of all colour and creeds together and about freeing up minds and engaging them on a natural and spiritual level. “When I’m on stage I see myself on the same level as the audience,” says the artist who is also something of a perfectionist. She pours all her focus into her music, but also into the flyers for her own parties and the beautiful covers of her musical releases. As such she is a warm and creative soul who simply wants to connect with people in any way she can.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Cassy is a strong, independent and unique individual whose feminine power and sensitive musical flow delivers diverse techno with soul, warmth, elegance and a touch of mystery. “Always since I can remember, especially in the Austrian village I grew up in, I was surrounded by music. One of my first and strongest musical memories is of having a ladybird turntable, I played it so much it was demolished in the end.” 

Born in England and raised in Austria, with her mother from Austria and father from Barbados, Cassy was exposed to many cultures growing up. She went to music school at the age of five before joining a local children’s choir, where she would wear traditional Austrian dress and sing in monasteries. As a young girl, Cassy met jazz musicians including Sun Ra, Archie Shepp and Lester Bowie, when they stayed at her parent’s countryside inn on their way to play an Austrian jazz festival, organized by her parents’ friends. 

“Sun Ra was this super mega cosmic guy, an out there character. These people must have been a big influence on me. They left a trace behind of somewhere I knew I belonged, without knowing how to get there.”

Influenced by her parents, Cassy grew up listening mostly to Chaka Khan and Sade, alongside an eclectic selection including Spandau Ballet, Madness, Sarah Vaughan, Talking Heads, The Cure, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. In her teens she attended singing lessons and studied A-Levels in music, learning a few musical instruments, with the focus on guitar. “At this stage I always felt like I was way too shy to do it properly. I didn’t believe that I could be a musician like the ones who came to stay at my parents, but, it was my deepest wish.” 

In the early 90s, Vienna started developing a strong techno scene, exposing artists like Kruder & Dorfmeister. Cassy loved and frequented a soul and funk night, Soul Seduction, which lead to her discovering Gilles Peterson and the influential label Talking Loud. “Around this time I also started buying records from the local record shop, Black Market, a bit of drum n bass, Hip Hop, House, Techno, a mix of things. I was never differentiating music.”

At 20 she moved to London to attend drama school for what she calls “The serious study years for drama training. I learnt a lot but I realised this wasn’t my path.” She came back to Vienna and arrived directly back into the music scene. “It was around then I started singing to electronic music and soon I started DJing. I got obsessed and didn’t want to stop.” 

Her first gig was at Flex in Vienna with Electric Indigo, who, alongside artists Acid Maria and Miss Kittin, became Cassy’s first mentor. “I was really influenced by and look up to these women. Susanne (Electric Indigo) was DJing a lot at raves and parties internationally and I would go with her. One day she said “Why don’t you start DJing yourself, and then you can come and you don’t have to pay for it”. I had an Austrian boyfriend in Cologne at the time and I would go record shopping at the Kompakt record store. 

I also began to experience different techno scenes in Germany, like the Munich scene with DJ Hell and Love Parade in Berlin and I slowly began to build my courage as a DJ. It took a while for me to take myself seriously and it began slowly, which was very good for me in the end. I could focus on my craft and move ahead step by step.” 

Making music soon followed and her first release was singing with Elin aka Autorepeat on ‘Music takes me Higher’, she then sang on a track for Zombie Nation and demand grew. Through Miss Kittin, Cassy travelled to Geneva and moved there soon after. Here she met Luciano, Quenum and Sonja Moonear and began releasing on Mental Groove. 

In 2003 Cassy moved to Berlin and got deep into the burgeoning underground scene. “I moved because Berlin was cheaper and there was a scene that was building into something. It was cool to have so many clubs and things going on and to be exposed to the DJs and nightlife. I could listen to music all the time and I felt like I was part of something. The energy helped for me to take myself seriously as I was surrounded by people who had the same interests. I was hanging and working with Mathew Jonson, Tobias, Steve Bug, Swayzak, Zip and Ricardo Villalobos and I was sometimes singing with Ricardo at after parties at places like Club Der Visionaere.”

In 2004, Berlin opened a new club, Panorama Bar, they offered labels different nights and they gave Luciano a Cadenza night. He offered Cassy to play in the first month of them opening and from that Panorama Bar asked her to come back as resident. She played once a month for three years and it led to her mixing the first Panorama Bar CD compilation. Her release output increased, with her putting out her own music on labels including Perlon, Ostgut Ton, Uzuri, Beatstreet, Playhouse and her own Cassy imprint, as well as mixing the heralded fabric 71.

Cassy left Berlin in 2010. She moved to Paris for a while, where she hung out mostly with her, as she calls him, best DJ friend, D’Julz, and held a residency at Rex Club. She then moved to Amsterdam, where she held a residency and Trouw, amidst a heavy international touring schedule. 
After initially being resident at Cocoon Ibiza on the Amnesia terrace, Cassy moved to Circo Loco the following year, where she still holds her residency today. “I am very happy playing there, I enjoy the vibe and the energy and especially now I can play more open and interesting.”
 
In 2016 Cassy will release her debut artist album, produced with King Britt. As un-yet unnamed, her emotive, soulful voice features on almost every track of the album, which draws you in, telling a story of her journey in human relationships. There is also possible talk of her going live with the album, in her own way and in her own time.

An honest, true and powerful feminine force, Cassy is an artist who knows and speaks her mind and stands strong as a unique inspiration in dance music. 
Asking what inspires her, Cassy replied: “Be yourself and if you can’t be yourself, be Chaka Khan.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Dave Clarke is a DJ with an anarchist streak a mile wide and punk in his soul. Technologically, he’s an early adopter with the studio to prove it, but he also embraces sounds outside the staunch electronic dance remit, from Nick Cave to Savages to old favourites Bauhaus. Such music informs his attitude as, using Serato on a 13” Macbook Pro Retina for his ruthlessly effective, fat-free club sets, he pushes the worldwide boundaries of what techno and electro can be.

After a break , recent years have seen him make his presence as a producer felt again, working with Dutch partner Mr Jones (Jonas Uittenbosch) as and dropping remixes ranging from John Foxx’s seminal synth-pop gem ‘Underpass’ to Gesaffelstein, Detroit Grand Pubas and Octave One. Not a week passes when he doesn’t live up to his nickname, the Baron of Techno, a moniker given him by the late, great BBC Radio DJ John Peel.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[De Sluwe Vos (Dutch for 'The Sly Fox', a name derived from Aesop's fable of the Fox and the Crow) is the newest addition to the Dutch house and techno scene. His productions are supported by artists such as DJ Sneak, Joy Orbison, Boddika and Bicep. Moreover, De Sluwe Vos has a packed tour schedule and travels many miles for all his national and international gigs.
With strong hooks and dirty kicks as his specialities, De Sluwe Vos has released multiple tracks on labels like 4Lux and Slapfunk. Lately, this cheerful producer from Dutch city of Deventer has even been gaining a foothold in the pop scene. His gig at Noorderslag did not go unnoticed: national music platform 3voor12 named him the best act of the festival.

De Sluwe Vos mixes various styles to create his own 'signature sound' with which he manages to constantly keep himself at the center of attention. His 'OG Anthem' is possibly one of the most notable tracks of the moment; this underground hit found its way to the surface and received airplay on both Dutch radio station 3FM and BBC Radio1. With his discography, De Sluwe Vos is constructing a steady career. But he's not one to stay hidden away in the studio: he's at his best when dominating dance floors in clubs and at festivals. His ultimate goal is to bring the crowd to a higher state of mind, where worries simply disappear and the music takes over. 

Time and time again, De Sluwe Vos provides proof for the big bang theory with his performances. Whether it's at Awakenings Festival in the Netherlands or at Together Festival in Cardiff: during his shows he is pure energy. His duet between his Roland TR- 909 drum computer and turntables is always a bold endeavor, just like his stage diving. The fact that he is a fixture of the club scene is proven by his monthly international gigs, his own night The Core and his notorious live act. With the audiovisual show 'Kontra live', De Sluwe Vos is well underway to becoming 'one of the greats'. And that's no fable!]]></description>

Prior to his solo career, Dubfire was one half of the four times nominated and Grammy Award-winning duo, Deep Dish. Dubfire's style is noticeably different from that of Deep Dish, consisting of techno rather than progressive house. 

During his youth he listened to mostly classic hip hop, jazz/rare groove, dub, new wave and industrial and was also influenced by the local punk scene and the music of Washington DC-based bands including Fugazi and Minor Threat. Shirazinia frequented a local record store called Yesterday And Today Records, where he became acquainted with the sounds of artists like Kraftwerk, Ministry, Jesus & Mary Chain, Depeche Mode, Nitzer Ebb, Adrian Sherwood of On-U Sound and Einstürzende Neubauten.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Ellen Allien (born in Berlin as Ellen Fraatz) is a German electronic musician, music producer, and the founder of BPitch Control music label. Her album Stadtkind was dedicated to the city of Berlin, and she cites the culture of reunified Berlin as one of the main inspirations for her music. She sings in both German and English. Her music is best described as a blend of IDM and Techno music, which is dance-floor oriented and has noticeable experimental elements. She currently lives in Berlin.

Ellen Allien was born and grew up in West Berlin. During 1989, she lived in London where she first came into contact with electronic music. When she later returned to Berlin, electronic music had become increasingly popular in Germany. In 1992, she became resident DJ at the Bunker, Tresor, and E-Werk.[3][2] She started her own show on the Berlin radio station Kiss FM and created her own record label, calling them both "Braincandy". Due to problems with distribution, she gave the Braincandy label up in 1997 and instead began organizing parties with the name, "Pitch Control". Allien created the label BPitch Control in 1999.

She released her first album, Stadtkind, in 2001, and her second album, Berlinette, in 2003. In 2005, after releasing the album Thrills, Allien created a BPitch sublabel called "Memo Musik" for minimal tech and minimal house. Orchestra of Bubbles, a collaboration with Apparat, was released in 2006. During the same year, Allien launched her own fashion line, "Ellen Allien Fashion", which can be seen as "an extension of her philosophy of life"]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Jeff Mills is considered the most brilliant DJ and producer of Techno Music in the World. He is the most recoｇnized representative figure of Detroit Techno , where he began his career as a DJ on the WDRQ radio in 1984. He has created with “Mad Mike Banks” the collective “Underground Resistance”, which became a reference in the electro sphere. In 1992, Jeff Mills created his own label in Chicago :with “Axis”, he could keep his artistic independence and produce his own timeless electronic music compositions, inspired of science fiction. 

Jeff Mills’ artistic career goes much further than techno music. For over a decade, he’s been transcending disciplines with a large number of collaborations in contemporary art. Interested in cinema and attracted by images, Jeff Mills started working, in 2000, on the fusion of image and sound. In 2000, he created and presented at the Centre Pompidou a new sound track for the film “Metropolis” by Fritz Lang. A year after, he created “Mono”, an installation inspired by the movie “2001, a Space Odyssey”, by Stanley Kubrick. In 2004, Jeff Mills produced the DVD “Exhibitionist” which presents DJ sets filmed from various angles (from front, top and side). 

At that same period, he acquired a new tool, the DVJ-X which allowed him to manipulate image and sound together paving the way into the Art World. In 2005, Jeff Mills made, for MK2, a new sound track for the silent movie “Three Ages” by Buster Keaton, and created a serie of 6 video art works presented in Paris at the Galerie Georges-Philippe et Nathalie Vallois and at the « rendez-vous vidéo » of the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Rouen. 

Jeff Mills continued this work period with a production on Josephine Baker, presented during the FIAC 2005 in the Grand Palais. On July 2nd 2005, Jeff Mills played together with the Philharmonic Orchestra of Montpellier, for the 20th anniversary of the Pont du Gard's inclusion in the world heritage list by UNESCO. Together with the orchestra, Jeff Mills performed his own compositions, orchestrated by Thomas Roussel for this occasion. In 2007, he was invited by the movie director Claire Denis to create the sound environment of the exhibition « Diaspora » at the musée du quai Branly in Paris.. 

That same year, Jeff Mills received the title of « Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres» from the French ministry of Culture. In 2008, Jeff Mills was commissioned to create a comtemporary installation for 100 Year Anniversary of the Futurist Manifesto at the Pompidou Center. 

At the Sonar Festival in Barcelona, Jeff Mills and « Mad Mike Banks » were together again for an historical performance called « X-102, Rediscovers the Rings of Saturn », mixing video and music. Always busy, Jeff Mills is involved in numerous projects at this time. The next event: For the 100 Year anniversary of the famous director, Cecil B. DeMille, he'll perform a Cinenamix at the French Cinematheque in Paris April 2nd.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[DJ and producer Marcel Dettmann is recognised as being one of the most influential proponents of contemporary techno. Widely associated with iconic trademarks including Berlin, Berghain and Hard Wax, Dettmann stays true to his roots by consistently innovating his interpretation of electronic music, and, nevertheless, integrating art deeply into the music scene.

Raised in the former GDR, in a small town near Berlin, Dettmann had already begun to develop his passion for electronic music in his youth. You can count bands like Depeche Mode, The Cure and Front 242, as well as post-punk, EBM and industrial as his earliest influences, long before he discovered his affinity for techno. His hometown was seeing a lack of a record store being specialized in electronic music, so between 1995 and 1998 Dettmann has been selling vinyl from his own home. He purchased records from various distributers, Hard Wax amongst others, both to resell to his friends and to cement the foundation for his own considerable collection.

Like many of his friends, the mid-nineties saw Dettmann frequenting Berlin’s nightlife. This included club institutions E-Werk and Tresor where the resident DJs of that time aroused his passion for the Chicago and Detroit influenced sound. In 1999, after many, including self-organised parties as well; the turning point came up; Dettmann started working as a resident DJ at Ostgut, Berghain’s predecessor. Shortly thereafter upon receiving a job offer from Hard Wax, he finally moved to Berlin. His apprenticeship as a vinyl buyer and seller as well as DJ, granted him an extensive depth of musical knowledge and intuition.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[THE ACID QUEEN- Saskia Slegers, better known as Miss Djax, or as many say 'The Acid Queen', is living proof that age doesn't necessarily always brings peace. For 25 years now, she has stomped on the face of techno and acid with hard punishing beats and radioactive sounds. The ferocious releases on her Djax-Up-Beats label helped Chicago and Detroit sounds gain foothold in Europe, as Djax Records was one of the first European labels to put out techno in the early nineties. Now 25 years later Djax can look back at an impressive catalog of over 400 releases!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Berlin’s Paul Kalkbrenner is a unique international talent. In fact, with seven studio albums and more than 2.3 million Facebook fans, he is one of techno’s biggest superstars. In a time where the big drops of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and cake throwing DJs seem to reign supreme, Paul Kalkbrenner is keeping his cool. He trusts in his remarkable talent as a producer and live-act. No added artificial flashiness needed. 

He can rave with the best of them, raise his arms to full dance floor delirium, but his head will never spin right off. Paul Kalkbrenner’s demanding compositions are full of energy … they exist to take listeners away from the everyday, from the weekly grind, into rapture – into art, ecstasy, absurdity friendship, hope and love.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[For the past 20 years, Jeroen Verheij aka Secret Cinema has consistently been regarded as one of Netherland’s, if not the world’s top techno producers and live acts. During this time he has produced some of the biggest techno anthems including Timeless Altitude, Sonar System, Mary Go Wild and two of the popular tunes on Sven Vath’s Cocoon Records – Shake Your Tech Ass & Kurzweil. He has headlined many of the biggest festivals around the globe including closing the Awakenings Festival (a spot that only Secret Cinema, Richie Hawtin, Adam Beyer and Dave Clarke have held since its inception).


Jeroen lives and breathes electronic music not to mention, he still holds as much passion and enthusiasm on stage as he did in the early 90′s. After the lengthy success of his solo Secret Cinema project, Jeroen has focused his energy toward a new venture aptly named “Gem” which is a platform consisting of Gem Records (one of the fastest growing global techno labels) and the highly regarded Gem events which has built an absolute cult following over the past several years. To put it simply, Secret Cinema is one of the brightest shining Gems of the global techno scene and will continue to shine for many years to come!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Tom Trago’s relationship with music has always been particularly intense. “I couldn’t imagine life without music,” he says. “I feel this physical need to make music every day. It’s like my body needs it as much as it needs food, water or sunshine.” Right now, Trago’s immersion in music is almost total. 

An internationally renowned DJ, producer, live performer and label owner with three critically acclaimed albums to his name, the Dutchman divides his time between all-day studio sessions, DJ gigs and live shows all over the world, and a steady stream of musical collaborations. You sometimes wonder how he finds time to sleep.

His dedication to the cause has been unflinching since his earliest years. He grew up in a free-spirited, artistic household, surrounded by music and encouraged to make his own. He entertained himself by recording his own home-made radio shows using the weird and wonderful albums he found in his parents’ record collection.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[“We are fascinated by eastern music and its codes, such as complex rhythmic structures (binary and ternary superimposing upon each other), which drive dancers to trance just like acid house does. We’d like to take these codes and use analog techno devices (beatboxes, bassline machines) to create something new : an oriental acid music which combines the coldness of techno and the emotional and dramatic power of the East. 

Our knowledge of the dancefloor is now digested and we have spent night after night digging records and files to know more about arabic music. We don’t want to be standardbearers of mixing whatever, we just want to be of our days. talking about mixing means there’s a split, a binary vision of an occidental vs oriental world – this is has-been. 

We don’t paste oriental sounds on occidental beats, we want to embody both cultures without pretending to reinvent oriental music or fooling ourselves by believing we’re inventing eastern dance music. We just want to be part of it, and contribute to this brilliant and enormous masterpiece that this music is, and has been for thousands of years.” 

Acid Arab is: Guido Minisky & Hervé Carvalho & Pierrot Casanova & Nicolas Borne. Keyboards: Kenzy Bourras]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Beirut is an American band which was originally the solo musical project of Santa Fe native Zach Condon, and later expanded into a band. Beirut's music combines elements of indie-rock and world music. The band's first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar. Despite their name, Beirut had never performed in Lebanon until they appeared at the Byblos International Festival in August 2014.

Here is an explanation of band's name by Condon: “One of the reasons I named the band after that city was the fact that it’s seen a lot of conflict. It’s not a political position. I worried about that from the beginning. But it was such a catchy name. I mean, if things go down that are truly horrible, I’ll change it. But not now. It’s still a good analogy for my music. I haven’t been to Beirut, but I imagine it as this chic urban city surrounded by the ancient Muslim world. The place where things collide”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Nneka Lucia Egbuna (born 24 December 1980) is a Nigerian hip hop/soul/reggae singer, songwriter and actress. She sings in both Igbo and English. Even though Nneka sings more than she raps, she names hip hop as her primary musical root and most important source of inspiration, while citing artists such as Fela Kuti and Bob Marley as well as contemporary rappers Mos Def, Talib Kweli, and Lauryn Hill as key influences in her own pursuit of musical recognition. 

Her lyrics reflect much of her history and life in Nigeria as well as her time spent in Western Europe. Her songs stress the issues of capitalism, poverty and war and are often loaded with moral and biblical messages and references, with some music commentators comparing her to Erykah Badu, Neneh Cherry, and Floetry]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Youssou N'Dour (French pronunciation: ​[jusu nˈduʁ]; born 1 October 1959) is a Senegalese singer, percussionist, songwriter, composer, occasional actor, businessman and a politician. In 2004, Rolling Stone described him as, "perhaps the most famous singer alive" in Senegal and much of Africa. From April 2012 to October 2012, he was Senegal's Minister of Tourism and Culture, and from October 2012 to September 2013, he was Senegal's Minister of Tourism and Leisure.

N'Dour helped to develop a style of popular Senegalese music known in the Serer language as mbalax, which derives from the conservative Serer music tradition of "Njuup". He is the subject of the award-winning films Return to Goree directed by Pierre-Yves Borgeaud and Youssou N'Dour: I Bring What I Love directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, which were released around the world. In 2006, N'Dour was cast as Olaudah Equiano in the film Amazing Grace.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[It was in 2009 that Mat McNerney settled down in Finland – the oddball country of Scandinavia, where the humour is as dark as the winter afternoons and the nature as breathtaking as their moonshine. Originally from the UK, he came here via stints in Norway and Holland, already with weight to his name in the underground of extreme and avantgarde metal music, having sung and written in bands like Dødheimsgard and Code among many more, sometimes under the moniker of Kvohst. Later, he achieved success with modern post punk darlings Beastmilk and its spin-off Grave Pleasures.

In Finland he found his “kin”, and there he invoked Hexvessel – a band founded to voice Mat’s inner self, and to connect it with the vast cosmic infinity around him. Simply: to play psychedelic music in the true sense of the term.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Walker began his career in Chicago's independent music scene after moving there in the early 2010s, releasing several cassette EPs and a vinyl EP. In 2014 he released his debut album for the Tompkins Square label, and followed it early in 2015 with Primrose Green released on Dead Oceans. Backing musicians Walker employed on Primrose Green include several noted Chicago jazz and experimental musicians such as Fred Lonberg-Holm.

Also in 2015, Walker released an instrumental album, recorded in collaboration with fellow Chicago musician Bill MacKay, entitled Land of Plenty. It was recorded live during a January 2015 residency at The Whistler in Chicago. The songs on the album were taken from the last two shows of the residency, on January 25th and 30th. MacKay's guitar was recorded on the left channel and Walker's guitar was recorded on the right channel. Their instruments converge in the center. 

MacKay played 6-string guitar, requinto and glass slide, while Walker played 6 & 12-string guitars. The album's sound was described as fingerstyle ballads, psychedelic waltzes, and raga-inspired blues]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Jah Shaka, also known as the Zulu Warrior, is a legendary reggae/dub soundsystem operator and producer. Based in the UK, he has been operating his sound since the mid-1970s. In the 1980s, he was famous for keeping up his roots and culture agenda, while most of the UK soundsystems followed the Jamaican trend for digital dancehall riddims and "slackness" lyrics. While this move placed him outside the reggae mainstream, he aquired a new (white as well as black) following. 

His fans and musical cooperators, like The Disciples, Jah Warrior and Iration Steppas went on to coin a distinct electronic style of dub nowadays typical for the UK. With his strictly Rastafarian attitude and the dry and heavy sound of his productions, which are (in contrary to most of the more recent UK dub) recorded with live instruments, yet stripped down to the maximum, Jah Shaka is considered the forefather of UK Dub.

On his label, Jah Shaka Music, which has been operating since the early 1980s, he released not only crucial dub albums, like his classical "Commandments of Dub" series, but also various vocal cuts by artists like Max Romeo, Horace Andy and Johnny Clarke.

Jah Shaka still plays on his soundsystem on a regular basis in the UK and from time to time in other countries, finally having recovered after heavy house fire injuries in 2000. His soundsystem gigs are a cultural institution that layed a huge impact not only on the developement of dub, but on English popular music altogether. His sets introduced not only many future apostles of UK dub to roots music, but also influenced mainstream producers like Basement Jaxx.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[A world-class soloist, accomplished composer and formidable bandleader, saxophonist Chris Potter has emerged as a leading light of his generation. Down Beat called him "One of the most studied (and copied) saxophonists on the planet" while Jazz Times identified him as "a figure of international renown." Jazz sax elder statesman Dave Liebman called him simply, "one of the best musicians around," a sentiment shared by the readers of Down Beat in voting him second only to tenor sax great Sonny Rollins in the magazine's 2008 Readers Poll.

A potent improvisor and the youngest musician ever to win Denmark's Jazzpar Prize, Potter's impressive discography includes 15 albums as a leader and sideman appearances on over 100 albums. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for his solo work on "In Vogue," a track from Joanne Brackeen’s 1999 album Pink Elephant Magic, and was prominently featured on Steely Dan’s Grammy-winning album from 2000, Two Against Nature. He has performed or recorded with many of the leading names in jazz, such as Herbie Hancock, Dave Holland, John Scofield, the Mingus Big Band, Jim Hall, Paul Motian, Dave Douglas, Ray Brown and many others.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Over the course of a nearly five-decade career, bassist/composer Dave Holland has never stopped evolving, reinventing his concept and approach with each new project while constantly honing his instantly identifiable voice. 

From the electric whirlwind of Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew-era band to the elegant flamenco of his collaboration with Spanish guitar legend Pepe Habichuela; accompanying the great vocalist Betty Carter in her last years to forging a new sound with the pioneering avant-garde quartet Circle alongside Chick Corea, Anthony Braxton, and Barry Altschul; standing alongside legends like Stan Getz, Hank Jones, Roy Haynes, and Sam Rivers to providing early opportunities to now-leading players like Chris Potter, Kevin and Robin Eubanks, or Steve Coleman; Dave Holland has been at the forefront of jazz in many of its forms since his earliest days.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Dhafer Youssef is a Tunisian Oud player, vocalist and composer born in November 19th, 1967 in Teboulba. Descendent of a modest family from this Center-eastern fishing village, he comes from a long line of muezzins. For him mastering vocal performances is a heritage.

At an early age, his grandfather initiated him to quranic recitals. Thus, he started discovering the potential of his voice. He found his vocation.Far from the quranic school bunches and from his grandfather’s hard discipline, Dhafer Youssef tested his voice singing the songs played on his mother radio set. Far from rigorist methods, His mother’s kitchen became his first experimental laboratory. At the age of 6 years old, he discovered inside these walls the echo of his voice and its resonances. He remembers spending hours singing in the Hammam of the local village. The resonances produced by his voice in that cavernous place fascinated him. It nourished his ardent juvenile curiosity. This is how the young Dhafer discovered his favored toy.

Moved by the child beautiful voice, the local muezzin encouraged him to record his call to prayer for the village’s mosque on a tape. Dhafer youssef undertook the task using cheap plastic microphone.His voice flowed from the top of the minaret. Its resonances strengthened. It was his first encounter with his first audience, a memorable experience that he will never forget despite his eight albums and hundreds of live performances all over the world.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Joshua Redman is one of the most acclaimed and charismatic jazz artists to have emerged in the decade of the 1990s. Born in Berkeley, California, he is the son of legendary saxophonist Dewey Redman and dancer Renee Shedroff. He was exposed at an early age to a variety of musics (jazz, classical, rock, soul, Indian, Indonesian, Middle-Eastern, African) and instruments (recorder, piano, guitar, gatham, gamelan), and began playing clarinet at age nine before switching to what became his primary instrument, the tenor saxophone, one year later. 

The early influences of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Cannonball Adderley and his father, Dewey Redman, as well as The Beatles, Aretha Franklin, the Temptations, Earth, Wind and Fire, Prince, The Police and Led Zeppelin drew Joshua more deeply into music. But although Joshua loved playing the saxophone and was a dedicated member of the award-winning Berkeley High School Jazz Ensemble and Combo from 1983-86, academics were always his first priority, and he never seriously considered becoming a professional musician.]]></description>

Her mother is from Saint Kitts and her father is from Jamaica. In 2005, Mvula sang with Black Voices, an a cappella group set up by her aunt.

Mvula was Director of the Lichfield Community Gospel Choir, founded by Black Voices and Lichfield Festival in 2009. 

She has also previously directed the Alvechurch Community Choir. Mvula graduated from the Birmingham Conservatoire at the Birmingham City University with a degree in composition. While she was working as a supply teacher in a Birmingham secondary school, she started writing songs on her laptop. She was working as a receptionist when she sent out two demos to several people in the music industry. One of them, Steve Brown, heard the songs and sent them to his manager, Kwame Kwaten, who would become Mvula's manager. In a 2013 podcast for The Daily Telegraph, Mvula admitted to suffering from "crippling stage fright"]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Lizz Wright continues her genre-defying journey with Fellowship, a nod to her roots in gospel on the one hand and her gospel of eclecticism on the other. Beginning with the ecumenical Me’Shell N’Degeocello-penned title track, Fellowship is not a traditional genre exercise. While emphasizing a healthy dose of the rousing hymnody Wright grew up singing in the church (she is, indeed, the daughter of a Georgia pastor), the album borrows from the decidedly secular catalogs of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Gladys Knight, topped by even more modern material from Joan Wasser, of the indie-rock act, Joan as Police Woman. Wright says, “I wanted to do some songs from home and some straight-up gospel, but I also had some other things I want to share that I see as sacred.’”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Bad Plus is a collective made up of bassist Reid Anderson, pianist Ethan Iverson, and drummer David King. All three are from the Midwest and they have known each other since their teens. Nonetheless, with the exception of one unimpressive meeting in 1990, it is only after spending their formative 20s apart -- King as a session player in Los Angeles, Iverson as the musical director for the Mark Morris Dance Group, Anderson as a prominent up-and-coming player on the New York jazz scene -- that they reunited in late 2000 to play a weekend club date in Minneapolis. The chemistry was immediate and obvious. They planned a second gig and a one-day recording session for the indie jazz label Fresh Sound and The Bad Plus was born.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Think saxophones, and most of us will immediately start thinking of jazz, specifically trad jazz. No bad thing, maybe, as there are few instruments as beautiful as the saxophone, and few sounds as effortlessly beautiful as jazz, but YolanDa Brown is someone who has made the instrument truly her own, a miraculously gifted saxophonist fluent in a whole lot more than just that one genre. Charismatic and charming, YolanDa Brown is the double MOBO Award-winning saxophonist, widely regarded as the emerging “voice” of mainstream jazz in the UK.

YolanDa has toured with The Temptations, Errol Brown, Alexander O’Neal, Courtney Pine, Diana Krall and has played with Jools Holland’s Rhythm & Blues Orchestra. In her own right, YolanDa is one of the most exciting and in-demand live performers on the contemporary music scene. “April Showers, May Flowers”, YolanDa’s debut album reached number one in both the Amazon and iTunes jazz charts, although her music is a wonderful mix of genres, touching on jazz, soul and reggae.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Jacob Collier is recognized as one of the world’s most distinctive, inventive and prodigious young musicians. Based in London, UK, Jacob has been inspired by many sounds – his music combines elements of Jazz, A cappella, Groove, Folk, Trip-hop, Classical music, Brazilian music, Gospel, Soul and Improvisation (to name a few), which culminate to create the world of "Jacob Collier." 

Jacob grew up in a family of musicians, and has honed his musical ideas from a very young age. He has embraced the world of the Internet to share his uniquely creative talent, becoming best known for creating his trademark multi-faceted YouTube videos from his music room at home, wherein he sings all the parts, plays all the instruments, and visualises every component with a mosaic of screens.

Since his first YouTube upload in December 2011, Jacob’s online social channels have garnered over 70K international subscribers and more than 4.2 million views. With viral hits such as his rendition of the Stevie Wonder classic, “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout A Thing,” Collier has garnered a global following, and some of his greatest fans among the elite Jazz community include Quincy Jones, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, Chick Corea, Steve Vai and Take 6, to name a few.]]></description>
